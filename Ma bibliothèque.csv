"Z9RS95XG","journalArticle","","Lankinen Kaisu, Saari Jukka","Consistency and similarity of MEG- and fMRI-signal time courses during movie viewing","","","","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.02.045","","Movie viewing allows human perception and cognition to be studied in complex, real-life-like situations in a brain-imaging laboratory. Previous studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and with magneto-and electroencephalography (MEG and EEG) have demonstrated consistent temporal dynamics of brain activity across movie viewers. However, little is known about the similarities and differences of fMRI and MEG or EEG dynamics during such naturalistic situations.We thus compared MEG and fMRI responses to the same 15-min black-and-white movie in the same eight subjects who watched the movie twice during both MEG and fMRI recordings. We analyzed intra-and intersubject voxel-wise correlations within each imaging modality as well as the correlation of the MEG envelopes and fMRI signals. The fMRI signals showed voxel-wise within-and between-subjects correlations up to r = 0.66 and r = 0.37, respectively, whereas these correlations were clearly weaker for the envelopes of band-pass filtered (7 frequency bands below 100 Hz) MEG signals (within-subjects correlation r < 0.14 and between-subjects r < 0.05). Direct MEG-fMRI voxel-wise correlations were unreliable. Notably, applying a spatial-filtering approach to the MEG data uncovered consistent canonical variates that showed considerably stronger (up to r = 0.25) between-subjects correlations than the univariate voxel-wise analysis. Furthermore, the envelopes of the time courses of these variates up to about 10 Hz showed association with fMRI signals in a general linear model. Similarities between envelopes of MEG canonical variates and fMRI voxel time-courses were seen mostly in occipital, but also in temporal and frontal brain regions, whereas intra-and intersubject correlations for MEG and fMRI separately were strongest only in the occipital areas.In contrast to the conventional univariate analysis, the spatial-filtering approach was able to uncover associations between the MEG envelopes and fMRI time courses, shedding light on the similarities of hemodynamic and electromagnetic brain activities during movie viewing.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:09:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29486325.0","","","","EEG/MEG; fMRI; Recording Technique; Relevent Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pioneering studyforrest and other naturalistic neuroimaging projects have provided free access to multiple movie-watching functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets to prompt the community for naturalistic experimental paradigms. However, sluggish blood-oxygenation-level-dependent fMRI signals are incapable of resolving neuronal activity with the temporal resolution at which it unfolds. Instead, magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures changes in the magnetic field produced by neuronal activity and is able to capture rich dynamics of the brain at the millisecond level while watching naturalistic movies. Herein, we present the first public prolonged MEG dataset collected from 11 participants while watching the 2 h long audio-visual movie Forrest Gump. Minimally preprocessed data was also provided to facilitate the use of the dataset. As a studyforrest extension, we envision that this dataset, together with fMRI data from the studyforrest project, will serve as a foundation for exploring the neural dynamics of various cognitive functions in real-world contexts.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:06:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35562378.0","","","","Dataset; OUT-OF-SCOPE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In some situations, in which the activity of interest cannot be reliably reproduced (e,g., epilepsy, learning, sleep states), accurate combined analysis requires simultaneous acquisition of EEG and fMRI. Simultaneous measurements ensure that the EEG and fMRI recordings reflect the exact same brain activity state. We took advantage of the spatial filtering properties of the bipolar montage to allow recording of very short (125-250 ms) visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) during fMRI, These EEG and fMRI measurements are of sufficient quality to allow source localization of the cortical generators. m addition, our source localization approach provides a combined EEG/fMRI analysis that does not require any manual selection of fMRI activations or placement of source dipoles, The source of the VEP was found to be located in the occipital cortex, Separate analysis of EEG and fMRI data demonstrated good spatial overlap of the observed activated sites. ks expected, the combined EEG/fMRI analysis provided better spatiotemporal resolution than either approach alone. The resulting spatiotemporal movie allows for the millisecond-to-millisecond display of changes in cortical activity caused by visual stimulation. These data reveal two peaks in activity corresponding to the N75 and the P100 components. This type of simultaneous acquisition and analysis allows for the accurate characterization of the location and timing of neurophysiological activity in the human brain, (C) 2001 Academic Press.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 11352609.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, the influence of attention on neural activity in the spinal cord during thermal sensory stimulation of the hand was investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging by systematically varying the participants' attention focus across and within repeated studies. Attention states included (1) attention to the stimulus by rating the sensation and (2) attention away from the stimulus by performing various mental tasks of watching a movie and identifying characters, detecting the direction of coherently moving dots within a randomly moving visual field and answering mentally-challenging questions. Functional MRI results spanning the cervical spinal cord and brainstem consistently demonstrated that the attention state had a significant influence on the activity detected in the cervical spinal cord, as well as in brainstem regions involved with the descending analgesia system. These findings have important implications for the detection and study of pain, and improved characterization of the effects of injury or disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we investigated the neural connectivity architecture of anger processing using a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) approach. Thirteen subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing anger-inducing film clips. Conventional fMRI and DCM analyses were conducted to identify a dominant connectivity model. Viewing anger-inducing film clips led to activation in the left superior temporal gyrus, left insula, and left orbitofrontal cortex (OK). The results of a group-level comparison of eight connectivity models based on conventional fMRI findings showed superiority of the model including reciprocal effective connectivities between the left insula, left superior temporal gyrus, and left orbitofrontal gyrus and bottom-up connectivity from the left superior temporal gyrus to the left orbitofrontal gyrus. Positive coupling effects were identified for connectivities between the left superior temporal gyrus and left insula and the left superior temporal gyrus and left OFC. A negative coupling effect was identified for connectivity between the left OFC and left insula. In conclusion, we propose a model of effective connectivity associated with the anger experience based on dynamic causal modeling. The findings have implications for various psychiatric disorders related to abnormalities in anger processing.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:12:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 32537036.0","","","","fMRI; Functional Connectivity; Short Clips","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to extend these findings of intersubject correlation to temporally accurate single-trial magnetoencephalography (MEG). A silent 15-min black-and-white movie was shown to eight subjects twice. We adopted a spatial filtering model and estimated its parameter values by using multi-set canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA) so that the intersubject correlation was maximized. The procedure resulted in multiple (mutually uncorrelated) time-courses with statistically significant intersubject correlations at frequencies below 10 Hz; the maximum correlation was 0.28 +/- 0.075 in the <= 1Hz band. Moreover, the 24-Hz frame rate elicited steady-state responses with statistically significant intersubject correlations up to 0.29 +/- 0.12. To assess the brain origin of the across-subjects correlated signals, the time-courses were correlated with minimum-norm source current estimates (MNEs) projected to the cortex. The time series implied across-subjects synchronous activity in the early visual, posterior and inferior parietal, lateral temporooccipital, and motor cortices, and in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) bilaterally. These findings demonstrate the capability of the proposed methodology to uncover cortical MEG signatures from single-trial signals that are consistent across spectators of a movie.

Using generative biophysical model of fMRI data such as Dynamic Causal Model (DCM), the underlying neuronal activities of different brain areas and their causal interactions (i.e., effective connectivity) can be calculated. Most DCM studies typically consider the effective connectivity to be static for a cognitive task within an experimental run. However, changes in experimental conditions during complex tasks such as movie-watching might result in temporal variations in the connectivity strengths. In this fMRI simulation study, we leverage state-of-the-art Physiologically informed DCM (P-DCM) along with a recurrent window approach and discretization of the equations to infer the underlying neuronal dynamics and concurrently the dynamic (time-varying) effective connectivities between various brain regions for task-based fMRI. Results from simulation studies on 3- and 10-region models showed that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses and effective connectivity time-courses can be accurately predicted and distinguished from faulty graphical connectivity models representing cognitive hypotheses. In summary, we propose and validate a novel approach to determine dynamic effective connectivity between brain areas during complex cognitive tasks by combining P-DCM with recurrent units.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:12:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 36936613.0","","","","fMRI; Functional Connectivity; Short Clips","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This task requires sufficiently similar cognitive schemas or psychological perspectives that act as filters to guide the selection, interpretation and storage of sensory information, perceptual objects and events. Here we show that when individuals adopt a similar psychological perspective during natural viewing, their brain activity becomes synchronized in specific brain regions. We measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from 33 healthy participants who viewed a 10-min movie twice, assuming once a 'social' (detective) and once a 'non-social' (interior decorator) perspective to the movie events. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity measures (inter-subject correlations; ISCs) of functional MRI data. We used k-nearest-neighbor and support vector machine classifiers as well as a Mantel test on the ISC matrices to reveal brain areas wherein ISC predicted the participants' current perspective. ISC was stronger in several brain regions-most robustly in the parahippocampal gyrus, posterior parietal cortex and lateral occipital cortex-when the participants viewed the movie with similar rather than different perspectives. Synchronization was not explained by differences in visual sampling of the movies, as estimated by eye gaze. We propose that synchronous brain activity across individuals adopting similar psychological perspectives could be an important neural mechanism supporting shared understanding of the environment.

This paper looks into a new direction of modeling the memorability of video clips and automatically predicting how memorable they are by learning from brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We propose a novel computational framework by integrating the power of low-level audiovisual features and brain activity decoding via fMRI. Initially, a user study experiment is performed to create a ground truth database for measuring video memorability and a set of effective low-level audiovisual features is examined in this database. Then, human subjects' brain fMRI data are obtained when they are watching the video clips. The fMRI-derived features that convey the brain activity of memorizing videos are extracted using a universal brain reference system. Finally, due to the fact that fMRI scanning is expensive and time-consuming, a computational model is learned on our benchmark dataset with the objective of maximizing the correlation between the low-level audiovisual features and the fMRI-derived features using joint subspace learning. The learned model can then automatically predict the memorability of videos without fMRI scans. Evaluations on publically available image and video databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 25314715.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the widely used methods for studying brain activity is functional magnetic resonance imaging, which is a neuroimaging procedure that measures brain activity based on the blood oxygenation level dependent effect. The blood oxygenation level dependent signal can be modeled as a linear convolution of a hemodynamic response function with an input signal corresponding to the neuronal activity. Estimating such input signals is a complicated problem.Methods: We present a software tool for estimation of brain neuronal activity, which uses a combination of Wiener filtering with deconvolution methods, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, the ordinary least squares method, and the Dantzig selector. The latter two are equipped with both established selection criteria (Akaike and Bayesian information criterion) as well as newly developed mixture criteria for selection of activations.Results: The software tool was tested on two types of data: measurements during basic visual experiments and during complex naturalistic audiovisual stimulation (watching a movie segment). During testing the software showed reasonable results, with the mixture criteria performing well for temporally extended activations.Conclusions: The presented software tool can be used for estimation, visualization, and analysis of brain neuronal activity from functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenation level dependent measurements.

Previous research on ISC reported anecdotal evidence of larger ISC during emotional scenes compared to neutral ones, but this effect has not been systematically investigated using standardized emotional movies. Moreover, the complex interplay between neuronal populations oscillating at different timescales was mainly studied through fMRI, thus with limited temporal resolution. This study aimed at showing how emotional movies synchronize brain activity in the main frequency bands characterizing cortical activity. Thirty-nine participants watched 18 movie clips selected from a standardized database of emotional movies (E-MOVIE) while their EEG activity was recorded. Spectrally resolved ISC was computed based on the coherence of homologous channels for each possible subject pair in the Delta, Alpha, and Gamma bands. Permutation-based statistics revealed that all emotional categories prompted larger ISC compared to the Neutral in each band. Moreover, high arousal erotic and fearful scenes prompted larger Delta-ISC and Gamma-ISC compared to the other categories. Finally, ISC topography followed a spatial gradient. At slower frequencies, ISC involved wider regions of the scalp, becoming more restricted to occipito-parietal regions at higher frequencies. Taken together, these results show that emotions trigger brain synchronization between individuals at multiple spatial and spectral scales. Different emotional states are reflected in specific topographical patterns of ISC in different frequency bands.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33460185.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For regular smokers, smoking is such a highly practiced motor skill that it often occurs automatically, without conscious awareness. Research on the brain basis of action observation has delineated a frontoparietal network that is commonly recruited when people observe, plan, or imitate actions. Here, we investigated whether this action observation network would be preferentially recruited in smokers when viewing complex smoking cues, such as those occurring in motion pictures. Seventeen right-handed smokers and 17 nonsmokers watched a popular movie while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using a natural stimulus, such as a movie, allowed us to keep both smoking and nonsmoking participants naive to the goals of the experiment. Brain activity evoked by movie scenes of smoking was contrasted with nonsmoking control scenes that were matched for frequency and duration. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers showed greater activity in left anterior intraparietal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus, regions involved in the simulation of contralateral hand-based gestures, when viewing smoking versus control scenes. These results demonstrate that smokers spontaneously represent the action of smoking when viewing others smoke, the consequence of which may make it more difficult to abstain from smoking.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 21248113.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We therefore examined whether emotion-induced bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation, and asthma control are related to specific patterns of brain activity during processing negative affective stimuli. Fifteen adults with asthma viewed alternating blocks of distressing film clips (negative condition), affectively neutral film clips (neutral condition), and a crosshair image (baseline condition) while undergoing blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI). Block-design fMRI analysis evaluated the BOLD response to negative-baseline and neutral-baseline contrasts. Airway response to these film clips was also assessed with impulse oscillometry in a separate session. Measures of airway inflammation [fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)] and asthma control [Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)] were additionally obtained. A whole brain voxel-based regression analysis of contrast maps was performed against respiratory resistance increase during negative and neutral films, FENO, and ACQ. Peak airway obstruction to negative affective stimulation was associated with stronger activation of the anterior and middle cingulate gyrus, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Stronger airway inflammation and lower asthma control were associated with reduced activation to negative stimuli in the superior frontal gyrus, middle cingulate gyrus, and supplementary motor area. Activation of the dACC in negativeaffect-induced airway obstruction could be part of an integrated defensive response to critical environmental change. In addition, reduced frontal and limbic activation during processing of negative affect may reflect consequences of pathophysiological processes for CNS functioning.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This functional magnetic resonance imaging study shows, for the first time, that the degree of airway constriction due to negative affective stimuli in asthma is associated with stronger response to these stimuli in the dorsal anterior and middle cingulate cortex. Asthma patients with stronger airway inflammation and reduced asthma control also show reduced activation in a number of cortical and subcortical areas relevant for affective processing and breathing control.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:12:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 30920889.0","","","","Bodily Signals; Disease-Related; fMRI; Link between neural correlates and bodily signals; Short Clips","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we utilize neural responses in the electroencephalogram( EEG) evoked by multiple presentations of short film clips to index brain states marked by high levels of correlation within and across subjects. We formulate a novel signal decomposition method which extracts maximally correlated signal components from multiple EEG records. The resulting components capture correlations down to a one-second time resolution, thus revealing that peak correlations of neural activity across viewings can occur in remarkable correspondence with arousing moments of the film. Moreover, a significant reduction in neural correlation occurs upon a second viewing of the film or when the narrative is disrupted by presenting its scenes scrambled in time. We also probe oscillatory brain activity during periods of heightened correlation, and observe during such times a significant increase in the theta band for a frontal component and reductions in the alpha and beta frequency bands for parietal and occipital components. Low-resolution EEG tomography of these components suggests that the correlated neural activity is consistent with sources in the cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. Put together, these results suggest that the observed synchrony reflects attention and emotion-modulated cortical processing which may be decoded with high temporal resolution by extracting maximally correlated components of neural activity.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:07:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 22623915.0","","","","EEG/MEG; Impact of Attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), principal component analyses (PCA) were employed to extract the prevailing temporal characteristics within each anatomical parcel of the Freesurfer Desikan-Killiany cortical atlas. A variety of alternative inter-subject correlation (ISC) approaches were then utilized to investigate the reliability of inter-subject synchronization during natural viewing. In the first analysis, the ISCs of the time series of each anatomical region over the full time period across all subject pairs were calculated and averaged. In the second analysis, dynamic ISC (dISC) analysis, the correlation was calculated over a sliding window of 200 ms with 3.3 ms steps. Finally, in a between-run ISC analysis, the between-run correlation was calculated over the dynamic ISCs of the two different runs after the Fisher z-transformation. Overall, the most reliable activations occurred in occipital/inferior temporal visual and superior temporal auditory cortices as well as in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, pre- and post-central gyri, and right inferior and middle frontal gyri. Significant between-run ISCs were observed in superior temporal auditory cortices and inferior temporal visual cortices. Taken together, our results show that movies can be utilized as naturalistic stimuli in MEG/EEG similarly as in fMRI studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Here we studied whether participants, who have different thinking styles but live within the same culture, exhibit differential brain activity when viewing a drama movie. A total of 26 Finnish participants, who were divided into holistic and analytical thinkers based on self-report questionnaire scores, watched a shortened drama movie during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We compared intersubject correlation (ISC) of brain hemodynamic activity of holistic vs analytical participants across the movie viewings. Holistic thinkers showed significant ISC in more extensive cortical areas than analytical thinkers, suggesting that they perceived the movie in a more similar fashion. Significantly higher ISC was observed in holistic thinkers in occipital, prefrontal and temporal cortices. In analytical thinkers, significant ISC was observed in right-hemisphere fusiform gyrus, temporoparietal junction and frontal cortex. Since these results were obtained in participants with similar cultural background, they are less prone to confounds by other possible cultural differences. Overall, our results show how brain activity in holistic vs analytical participants differs when viewing the same drama movie.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:08:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 30418656.0","","","","fMRI; Pattern Classification Given Behavioural Categories","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By contrast, a meaningless set of stimuli, such as a sequence of 'TV noise' frames, triggers always the same experience-of seeing 'TV noise'-even though the stimuli themselves are as different from each other as the movie frames. We reasoned that the differentiation of cortical responses underlying the subject's experiences, as measured by Lempel-Ziv complexity (incompressibility) of functional MRI images, should reflect the overall meaningfulness of a set of stimuli for the subject, rather than differences among the stimuli. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the differentiation of brain activity patterns in response to a movie sequence, to the same movie scrambled in time, and to 'TV noise', where the pixels from each movie frame were scrambled in space. While overall cortical activation was strong and widespread in all conditions, the differentiation (Lempel-Ziv complexity) of brain activation patterns was correlated with the meaningfulness of the stimulus set, being highest in the movie condition, intermediate in the scrambled movie condition, and minimal for 'TV noise'. Stimulus set meaningfulness was also associated with higher information integration among cortical regions. These results suggest that the differentiation of neural responses can be used to assess the meaningfulness of a given set of stimuli for a given subject, without the need to identify the features and categories that are relevant to the subject, nor the precise location of selective neural responses.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 25970444.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we propose a new framework for decoding such experiences using a distributed representation of words. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity evoked by natural movie scenes. Then, we constructed a high-dimensional feature space of perceptual experiences using skip-gram, a state-of-the-art distributed word embedding model. We built a decoder that associates brain activity with perceptual experiences via the distributed word representation. The decoder successfully estimated perceptual contents consistent with the scene descriptions by multiple annotators. Our results illustrate three advantages of our decoding framework: (1) three types of perceptual contents could be decoded in the form of nouns (objects), verbs (actions), and adjectives (impressions) contained in 10,000 vocabulary words; (2) despite using such a large vocabulary, we could decode novel words that were absent in the datasets to train the decoder; and (3) the inter-individual variability of the decoded contents co-varied with that of the contents of scene descriptions. These findings suggest that our decoding framework can recover diverse aspects of perceptual experiences in naturalistic situations and could be useful in various scientific and practical applications.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 28801255.0","","","","Decoding Emotional Dimensions; fMRI; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Neural Correlates of Shared Conscious Experience; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to study individual functional connectivity patterns, recent work has highlighted the benefits of collecting functional connectivity data while participants are exposed to naturalistic stimuli, such as watching a movie or listening to a story. For example, functional connectivity data collected during movie-watching were shown to predict cognitive and emotional scores more accurately than resting-state-derived functional connectivity. We have previously reported a tight link between resting-state functional connectivity and task-derived neural activity, such that the former successfully predicts the latter. In the current work we use data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that naturalistic-stimulus-derived functional connectivity predicts task-induced brain activation maps more accurately than resting-state-derived functional connectivity. We then show that activation maps predicted using naturalistic stimuli are better predictors of individual intelligence scores than activation maps predicted using resting-state. We additionally examine the influence of naturalistic stimulus type on prediction accuracy. Our findings emphasize the potential of naturalistic stimuli as a promising alternative to resting-state fMRI for connectome-based predictive modelling of individual brain activity and cognitive traits.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:09:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35680054.0","","","","fMRI; Functional Connectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"XB4TU5L2","journalArticle","","Whittingstall Kevin, Bartels Andreas","Integration of EEG source imaging and fMRI during continuous viewing of natural movies","","","","10.1016/j.mri.2010.03.042","","Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are noninvasive neuroimaging tools which can be used to measure brain activity with excellent temporal and spatial resolution, respectively. By combining the neural and hemodynamic recordings from these modalities, we can gain better insight into how and where the brain processes complex stimuli, which may be especially useful in patients with different neural diseases. However, due to their vastly different spatial and temporal resolutions, the integration of EEG and fMRI recordings is not always straightforward. One fundamental obstacle has been that paradigms used for EEG experiments usually rely on event-related paradigms, while fMRI is not limited in this regard. Therefore, here we ask whether one can reliably localize stimulus-driven EEG activity using the continuously varying feature intensities occurring in natural movie stimuli presented over relatively long periods of time. Specifically, we asked whether stimulus-driven aspects in the EEG signal would be co-localized with the corresponding stimulus-driven BOLD signal during free viewing of a movie. Secondly, we wanted to integrate the EEG signal directly with the BOLD signal, by estimating the underlying impulse response function (IRF) that relates the BOLD signal to the underlying current density in the primary visual area (V1). We made sequential fMRI and 64-channel EEG recordings in seven subjects who passively watched 2-min-long segments of a James Bond movie. To analyze EEG data in this natural setting, we developed a method based on independent component analysis (ICA) to reject EEG artifacts due to blinks, subject movement, etc., in a way unbiased by human judgment. We then calculated the EEG source strength of this artifact-free data at each time point of the movie within the entire brain volume using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). This provided for every voxel in the brain (i.e., in 3D space) an estimate of the current density at every time point. We then carried out a correlation between the time series of visual contrast changes in the movie with that of EEG voxels. We found the most significant correlations in visual area V1, just as seen in previous fMRI studies (Bartels A, Zeki, S, Logothetis NK. Natural vision reveals regional specialization to local motion and to contrast-invariant, global flow in the human brain. Cereb Cortex 2008;18(3):705-717), but on the time scale of milliseconds rather than of seconds. To obtain an estimate of how the EEG signal relates to the BOLD signal, we calculated the IRF between the BOLD signal and the estimated current density in area VI. We found that this IRF was very similar to that observed using combined intracortical recordings and fMRI experiments in nonhuman primates. Taken together, these findings open a new approach to noninvasive mapping of the brain. It allows, firstly, the localization of feature-selective brain areas during natural viewing conditions with the temporal resolution of EEG. Secondly, it provides a tool to assess EEG/BOLD transfer functions during processing of more natural stimuli. This is especially useful in combined EEG/fMRI experiments, where one can now potentially study neural-hemodynamic relationships across the whole brain volume in a noninvasive manner.

In theories of humor perception, three factors, non-seriousness, social context, and incongruity, have been implicated in humor. In another theory, however, elaboration and reinterpretation of contexts are considered to play a role in eliciting humor. Although the neural correlates of humor appreciation have been investigated using neuroimaging methods, only a few studies have conducted such experiments under natural conditions. In the present study, two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, using a comedy movie as a stimulus, were conducted to investigate the neural correlates of humor under natural conditions. The subjects' brain activity was measured while watching and enjoying a movie. In experiment 1, a parametric analysis showed that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and hippocampus/amygdala had a positive relationship with the subjective rating of funniness. In experiment 2, intersubject correlation was analyzed to investigate synchronized activity across all participants. Signal synchronization that paralleled increased funniness ratings was observed in the MPFC and hippocampus. Thus, it appears that both parametric and synchronized activity in the MPFC and hippocampus are important during humor appreciation. The present study has revealed the brain regions that are predominantly involved in humor sensation under natural condition.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 27756763.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Network centralities identify the principal functional regions, individual differences, and hub structure in brain networks. Neuroimaging studies using movie-watching have investigated brain function under naturalistic stimuli. Visual saliency is one of the promising measures for revealing cognition and emotions driven by naturalistic stimuli. This study investigated whether the visual saliency in movies was associated with network centrality. The study examined eigenvector centrality (EC), which is a measure of a region's influence in the brain network, and the participation coefficient (PC), which reflects the hub structure in the brain, was used for comparison. Static and time-varying EC and PC were analyzed by a parcel-based technique. While EC was correlated with brain activity in parcels in the visual and auditory areas during movie-watching, it was only correlated with parcels in the visual areas in the retinotopy task. In addition, high PC was consistently observed in parcels in the putative hub both during the tasks and the resting-state condition. Time-varying EC in the parietal parcels and time-varying PC in the primary sensory parcels significantly correlated with visual saliency in the movies. These results suggest that time-varying centralities in brain networks are distinctively associated with perceptual processing and subsequent higher processing of visual saliency.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 34435748.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ratings of the four categorical emotions and liking were used to predict hemodynamic responses in general linear model (GLM) analysis of the fMRI data. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to reveal discrete neural signatures of the four categories of music-induced emotions. To map neural circuits governing non-musical emotions, the subjects were scanned while viewing short emotionally evocative film clips. The GLM revealed that most emotions were associated with activity in the auditory, somatosensory, and motor cortices, cingulate gyrus, insula, and precuneus. Fear and liking also engaged the amygdala. In contrast, the film clips strongly activated limbic and cortical regions implicated in emotional processing. MVPA revealed that activity in the auditory cortex and primary motor cortices reliably discriminated the emotion categories. Our results indicate that different music-induced basic emotions have distinct representations in regions supporting auditory processing, motor control, and interoception but do not strongly rely on limbic and medial prefrontal regions critical for emotions with survival value.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:07:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33367590.0","","","","OUT-OF-SCOPE; UNRELATED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging activity while participants (N = 577) from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (www.cam-can.com) watched a movie. Watching the same movie induces significant intersubject synchronization of brain activity across participants. These cross-subject correlations suggest that viewers are processing incoming information in a similar (or shared) way. We show that with advancing age, synchrony is preserved in some areas, including the language network, but decreased in others, including the medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, and fronto-parietal network. Synchrony declines were driven by more idiosyncratic responding in older adults and were associated with regionally distinct temporal profiles and functional connectivity patterns, as well as declines in white matter integrity. These findings suggest that areas involved in language processing remain intact with age, while regions involved in attentional control and memory may show age-related declines, even in situations similar to daily life.

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion fMRI provides an appealing approach for imaging sustained brain activity during natural conditions because of its long-term temporal stability and ability to noninvasively quantify absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF). The present study used ASL perfusion fMRI to measure brain activation patterns associated with natural vision by concurrently recording CBF and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrasts while subjects were freely viewing a cartoon movie. Reliable quantitative whole-brain CBF values (similar to 60 mL/100g/min) as well as regional CBF values (45 similar to 80 mL/100g/min) were measured during movie viewing and resting states. The perfusion contrast revealed CBF increases in multiple visual pathway areas and frontal areas, and CBF decreases in ventromedial frontal cortex and superior temporal cortex during movie viewing compared to resting states. Concurrent BOLD contrast revealed similar but weaker activation and deactivation patterns. Regression analyses of both CBF data and BOLD data showed significant associations between activation in the middle temporal (MT) region and subjects' perception of motion. Region of interest analysis based on a priori literature-defined MT demonstrated significant monotonic stepwise associations between the intensity of motion perception and the CBF and BOLD signal changes.

Subjects (N ​= ​37) watched feature-length horror movies while their hemodynamic brain activity was measured with fMRI. Time-variable intersubject correlation (ISC) was used to quantify the reliability of brain activity across participants, and seed-based phase synchronization was used for characterizing dynamic connectivity. Subjective ratings of fear were used to assess how synchronization and functional connectivity varied with emotional intensity. These data suggest that acute and sustained fear are supported by distinct neural pathways, with sustained fear amplifying mainly sensory responses, and acute fear increasing activity in brainstem, thalamus, amygdala and cingulate cortices. Sustained fear increased ISC in regions associated with acute fear, and also amplified functional connectivity within this network. The results were replicated in an independent experiment with a different subject sample and stimulus movie. The functional interplay between cortical networks involved in sustained anticipation of, and acute response to, threat involves a complex and dynamic interaction that depends on the proximity of threat, and the need to employ threat appraisals and vigilance for decision making and response selection.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31926280.0","","","","no DOI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, boundaries can also occur at transitions between internal mental states, without relevant external input changes. To what extent do such 'internal boundaries' share neural response properties with externally driven boundaries? We conducted an fMRI experiment where subjects watched a series of short movies and then verbally recalled the movies, unprompted, in the order of their choosing. During recall, transitions between movies thus constituted major boundaries between internal mental contexts, generated purely by subjects' unguided thoughts. Following the offset of each recalled movie, we observed stereotyped spatial activation patterns in the default mode network, especially the posterior medial cortex, consistent across different movie contents and even across the different tasks of movie watching and recall. Surprisingly, the between-movie boundary patterns did not resemble patterns at boundaries between events within a movie. Thus, major transitions between mental contexts elicit neural phenomena shared across internal and external modes and distinct from within-context event boundary detection, potentially reflecting a cognitive state related to the flushing and reconfiguration of situation models.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35635753.0","","","","Event Boundaries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To study this, we presented 25 healthy subjects, during functional magnetic resonance imaging, the movie 'Memento' (director C. Nolan). In this movie, scenes are presented in chronologically reverse order with certain scenes briefly overlapping previously presented scenes. Such overlapping key-frames serve as effective memory cues for the viewers, prompting recall of relevant memories of the previously seen scene and connecting them with the concurrent scene. We hypothesized that these repeating key-frames serve as immediate recall cues and would facilitate reconstruction of the story piece-by-piece. The chronological version of Memento, shown in a separate experiment for another group of subjects, served as a control condition. Using multivariate event-related pattern analysis method and representational similarity analysis, focal fingerprint patterns of hemodynamic activity were found to emerge during presentation of key-frame scenes. This effect was present in higher-order cortical network with regions including precuneus, angular gyrus, cingulate gyrus, as well as lateral, superior, and middle frontal gyri within frontal poles. This network was right hemispheric dominant. These distributed patterns of brain activity appear to underlie ability to recall relevant memories and connect them with ongoing events, i.e., what goes with what in a complex story. Given the real-life likeness of cinematic experience, these results provide new insight into how the human brain recalls, given proper cues, relevant memories to facilitate understanding and prediction of everyday life events.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29409793.0","","","","Event Boundaries; fMRI; Modified Movie Stimulus; Neurocinematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During natural movie viewing, for example, inter-subject correlation (ISC) measured by fMRI is high in visual areas (Hasson et al., 2004). But the electrophysiological basis for this fMRI ISC has been controversial. Previous reports have only found ISC in low frequency bands-below 12 Hz (Chang et al., 2015). These findings stand in contrast to reports that gamma band oscillations-30 to 90 Hz-are highly stimulus-driven in visual cortex (Perry et al., 2015). To resolve this discrepancy, we carried out both ISC estimation and a novel inter-subject representational correlation analysis across six frequency bands extracted from MEG data of 24 subjects who each viewed four 5-min clips of an underwater documentary. Region-of-interest-based and vertex-based temporal ISC estimates confirmed that low-frequency bands are significantly synchronized in visual areas and that gamma band has low temporal correlation. We also found the representational geometry of movie scenes were related to structural statistics from the stimuli. Crucially, our results show that the gamma band oscillations also reflect prototypical brain response in scene representations formed in response to naturalistic stimuli as revealed by inter-subject representational correlation.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 32505697.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To inspect temporal dynamics, these correlation measures have been calculated over sliding time windows with necessary restrictions on the length of the temporal window that compromises the temporal resolution. Here, we show that it is possible to increase temporal resolution by using instantaneous phase synchronization (PS) as a measure of dynamic (time-varying) functional connectivity. We applied PS on an fMRI dataset obtained while 12 healthy volunteers watched a feature film. Narrow frequency band (0.04-0.07 Hz) was used in the PS analysis to avoid artifactual results. We defined three metrics for computing time-varying functional connectivity and time-varying intersubject reliability based on estimation of instantaneous PS across the subjects: (1) seed-based PS, (2) intersubject PS, and (3) intersubject seed-based PS. Our findings show that these PS-based metrics yield results consistent with both seed-based correlation and intersubject correlation methods when inspected over the whole time series, but provide an important advantage of maximal single-TR temporal resolution. These metrics can be applied both in studies with complex naturalistic stimuli (e.g., watching a movie or listening to music in the MRI scanner) and more controlled (e.g., event-related or blocked design) paradigms.

Although previous neuroimaging studies have showed that the amygdala and insula manifest reciprocal connectivity, the effective connectivities and modulatory patterns on the amygdala-insula interactions underpinning arousal are still largely unknown. One of the reasons may be attributed to static and discrete laboratory brain imaging paradigms used in most existing studies. In this study, by integrating naturalistic-paradigm (i.e., movie watching) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a computational affective model that predicts dynamic arousal for the movie stimuli, we investigated the effective amygdala-insula interactions and the modulatory effect of the input arousal on the effective connections. Specifically, the predicted dynamic arousal of the movie served as regressors in general linear model (GLM) analysis and brain activations were identified accordingly. The regions of interest (i.e., the bilateral amygdala and insula) were localized according to the GLM activation map. The effective connectivity and modulatory effect were then inferred by using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). Our experimental results demonstrated that amygdala was the site of driving arousal input and arousal had a modulatory effect on the reciprocal connections between amygdala and insula. Our study provides novel evidence to the underlying neural mechanisms of arousal in a dynamical naturalistic setting.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:10:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 37562718.0","","","","Arousal Impact; fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the neural correlates underlying IOVC are largely unknown especially in the free-viewing condition. In this study, we explored the neural correlates of IOVC using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye-tracking data acquired in a naturalistic paradigm. Specifically, we estimated IOVC of movie shots from eye-tracking data and then conducted two statistical analyses for functional inference, including a hypothesis-driven analyses [general linear model (GLM)] and a data-driven approach [intersubject correlation (ISC)]. The GLM analysis demonstrated that IOVC recruited two distinctive streams of neural systems. Specifically, neural activities in superior temporal gyrus, default mode network, and hippocampus were positively correlated with IOVC, whereas those in the primary and secondary visual cortices, as well as the dorsal attention network exhibited negative correlations. Further ISC analysis revealed that movie shots with higher IOVC evoked more synchronous brain activities in the primary auditory cortex, primary visual cortex, and superior parietal lobule compared to those shots with lower IOVC.

However, which mechanisms link descriptions of affective states to brain activity is unclear, with evidence supporting either local or distributed processing. A biologically favorable alternative is provided by the notion of gradient, which postulates the isomorphism between functional representations of stimulus features and cortical distance. Here, we use fMRI activity evoked by an emotionally charged movie and continuous ratings of the perceived emotion intensity to reveal the topographic organization of affective states. Results show that three orthogonal and spatially overlapping gradients encode the polarity, complexity and intensity of emotional experiences in right temporo-parietal territories. The spatial arrangement of these gradients allows the brain to map a variety of affective states within a single patch of cortex. As this organization resembles how sensory regions represent psychophysical properties (e.g., retinotopy), we propose emotionotopy as a principle of emotion coding.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31804504.0","","","","Continuous Self-Reporting; fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the precise origins of such reproducible responses remain incompletely understood. Here, we employed concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking to investigate the experimental and behavioral factors that influence fMRI activity and its intra- and inter-subject reproducibility during repeated movie stimuli. We found that widely distributed and highly reproducible fMRI responses were attributed primarily to the high-level natural content in the movie. In the absence of such natural content, low-level visual features alone in a spatiotemporally scrambled control stimulus evoked significantly reduced degree and extent of reproducible responses, which were mostly confined to the primary visual cortex (V1). We also found that the varying gaze behavior affected the cortical response at the peripheral part of V1 and in the oculomotor network, with minor effects on the response reproducibility over the extrastriate visual areas. Lastly, scene transitions in the movie stimulus due to film editing partly caused the reproducible fMRI responses at widespread cortical areas, especially along the ventral visual pathway. Therefore, the naturalistic nature of a movie stimulus is necessary for driving highly reliable visual activations. In a movie-stimulation paradigm, scene transitions and individuals' gaze behavior should be taken as potential confounding factors in order to properly interpret cortical activity that supports natural vision.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 27564573.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigated brain activity shortly after viewing distressing events as a function of whether memories for those events later intruded involuntarily. The postencoding period is particularly important because it is a period when clinical interventions could be applied. METHODS: A total of 32 healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing distressing film clips, interspersed with 5 minutes of awake (postencoding) rest. Voluntary memories of the films were assessed using free recall and verbal and visual recognition tests after a week, while intrusive (involuntary) memories were recorded in a diary throughout that week. RESULTS: When analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging responses related to watching the films, we replicated findings that those hotspots  (salient moments within the films) that would later become intrusive memories elicited higher activation in parts of the brain's salience network. Surprisingly, while the postencoding persistence of multivoxel correlation structures associated with entire film clips predicted subsequent voluntary recall, there was no evidence that they predicted subsequent intrusions. CONCLUSIONS: Results replicate findings regarding the formation of intrusive memories during encoding and extend findings regarding the consolidation of information in postencoding rest in relation to voluntary memory. While we provided a first step using a naturalistic paradigm, further research is needed to elucidate the role of postencoding neural processes in the development of intrusive memories.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:07:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 34454167.0","","","","Movie Recalling; OUT-OF-SCOPE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To conduct a DCM study, one needs to represent the experimental stimuli as a compact vector-valued function of time, which is hard in complex tasks such as book reading and natural movie watching. Deep learning provides the state-of-the-art signal representation solution, encoding complex signals into compact dense vectors while preserving the essence of the original signals. There is growing interest in using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a major family of deep learning techniques, in fMRI modeling. However, the generic RNNs used in existing studies work as black boxes, making the interpretation of results in a neuroscience context difficult and obscure.In this paper, we propose a new biophysically interpretable RNN built on DCM, DCM-RNN. We generalize the vanilla RNN and show that DCM can be cast faithfully as a special form of the generalized RNN. DCM-RNN uses back propagation for parameter estimation. We believe DCM-RNN is a promising tool for neuroscience. It can fit seamlessly into classical DCM studies. We demonstrate face validity of DCM-RNN in two principal applications of DCM: causal brain architecture hypotheses testing and effective connectivity estimation. We also demonstrate construct validity of DCM-RNN in an attention-visual experiment. Moreover, DCM-RNN enables end-to-end training of DCM and representation learning deep neural networks, extending DCM studies to complex tasks.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29782993.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we examined a functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset obtained during an emotional audio-movie stimulus associated with human life. We used Jackknife Correlation (JC) method to derive a representation of time-varying functional connectivity. We applied different binary measures and thoroughly investigated two weighted measures to study different properties of binary and weighted temporal networks. Using this approach, we indicated different aspects of human brain function during expressing different emotions. The findings of global and nodal measures could demonstrate a significant difference between emotions and significant regions in each emotion, respectively. Also, the temporal centrality properties of nodes were different in emotional states. Ultimately, we showed that the resulting measures of temporal snapshots created by JC method can distinguish between different emotions.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 32655710.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether and how knowledge of genetic relatedness translates into differential neurocognitive evaluation of observed social interactions has remained an open question. Here, we investigated how the human brain is engaged when viewing a moral dilemma between genetic vs. non-genetic sisters. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, a movie was shown, depicting refusal of organ donation between two sisters, with subjects guided to believe the sisters were related either genetically or by adoption. Although 90% of the subjects self-reported that genetic relationship was not relevant, their brain activity told a different story. Comparing correlations of brain activity across all subject pairs between the two viewing conditions, we found significantly stronger inter-subject correlations in insula, cingulate, medial and lateral prefrontal, superior temporal, and superior parietal cortices, when the subjects believed that the sisters were genetically related. Cognitive functions previously associated with these areas include moral and emotional conflict regulation, decision making, and mentalizing, suggesting more similar engagement of such functions when observing refusal of altruism from a genetic sister. Our results show that mere knowledge of a genetic relationship between interacting persons robustly modulates social cognition of the perceiver.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29079809.0","","","","fMRI; Pattern Classification Given Behavioural Categories; Short Clips; Subjective Rating","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These findings suggest that dynamic and stationary functional interactions may represent different aspects of brain function. However, the relationship between individual differences in time-varying and stationary connectivity and behavioral phenotypes remains elusive. To address this gap, we analyzed an open-access functional MRI dataset comprising participants aged 5-22 years, who watched two cartoon movie clips. We calculated regional brain activity, time-varying connectivity, and stationary connectivity, examining associations with age, sex, and behavioral assessments. Model comparison revealed that time-varying connectivity was more sensitive to age and sex effects compared with stationary connectivity. The preferred age models exhibited quadratic log age or quadratic age effects, indicative of inverted-U shaped developmental patterns. In addition, females showed higher consistency in regional brain activity and time-varying connectivity than males. However, in terms of behavioral predictions, only stationary connectivity demonstrated the ability to predict full-scale intelligence quotient. These findings suggest that individual differences in time-varying and stationary connectivity may capture distinct aspects of behavioral phenotypes.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 37480715.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and intra-cranial electro-encephalography (iEEG) measure two technically unrelated but spatially and temporally complementary sets of functional descriptions of human brain activity. In order to allow fine-grained spatio-temporal human brain mapping at the population-level, an effective comparative framework for the cortex-based inter-subject analysis of iEEG and fMRI data sets is needed.We combined fMRI and iEEG recordings of the same patients with epilepsy during alternated intervals of passive movie viewing and music listening to explore the degree of local spatial correspondence and temporal coupling between blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI changes and iEEG spectral power modulations across the cortical surface after cortex-based inter-subject alignment. To this purpose, we applied a simple model of the iEEG activity spread around each electrode location and the cortex-based inter-subject alignment procedure to transform discrete iEEG measurements into cortically distributed group patterns by establishing a fine anatomic correspondence of many iEEG cortical sites across multiple subjects.Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-modal inter-subject cortex-based distributed analysis for combining iEEG and fMRI data sets acquired from multiple subjects with the same experimental paradigm but with different iEEG electrode coverage. The proposed iEEG-fMRI framework allows for improved group statistics in a common anatomical space and preserves the dynamic link between the temporal features of the two modalities.

However, there is little research on the neural representation of subjective reward values of visual sexual stimuli (VSS) and on the role of these subjective valuations in the development of related addictive behaviors. Here, we investigate how neural reactivity to VSS is connected to individual preference using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During the fMRI scan, 72 men viewed different VSS film clips. Ratings regarding valence and sexual arousal were collected and used as parametric modulators in the fMRI analysis. Subjects also filled out questionnaires on self-reported symptoms of problematic pornography use (PPU). Firstly, we found that neural reactivity towards VSS clips in the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex was positively correlated with individual ratings of the respective VSS in all subjects. Second, the strength of the association between neural activity and sexual arousal ratings was positively correlated with self-reported symptoms of PPU. The first result suggests a precise appraisal of VSS according to individual preferences in established reward valuation regions. Secondly, stronger neural differentiation based on preference in participants with more PPU symptoms indicates an increased importance of VSS/preference fit in these individuals. This heightened correspondence between individual liking and neural activity may facilitate PPU development by increased signaling of incentive salience, thus boosting motivation to seek out and respond to these preferred stimuli.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 32598998.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that networks of brain areas tick together in participants who are viewing similar emotional events in a movie. Participants' brain activity was measured with functional MRI while they watched movies depicting unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant emotions. After scanning, participants watched the movies again and continuously rated their experience of pleasantness-unpleasantness (i.e., valence) and of arousal-calmness. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity measures [intersubject correlations (ISCs)] of functional MRI data. Valence and arousal time series were used to predict the moment-to-moment ISCs computed using a 17-s moving average. During movie viewing, participants' brain activity was synchronized in lower- and higher-order sensory areas and in corticolimbic emotion circuits. Negative valence was associated with increased ISC in the emotion-processing network (thalamus, ventral striatum, insula) and in the default-mode network (precuneus, temporoparietal junction, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus). High arousal was associated with increased ISC in the somatosensory cortices and visual and dorsal attention networks comprising the visual cortex, bilateral intraparietal sulci, and frontal eye fields. Seed-voxel-based correlation analysis confirmed that these sets of regions constitute dissociable, functional networks. We propose that negative valence synchronizes individuals' brain areas supporting emotional sensations and understanding of another's actions, whereas high arousal directs individuals' attention to similar features of the environment. By enhancing the synchrony of brain activity across individuals, emotions may promote social interaction and facilitate interpersonal understanding.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 22623534.0","","","","Continuous Self-Reporting; Emotional Topology; fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we examined the neural activity underlying the memory-enhancing effect of reminders 1 week after encoding of naturalistic film clip events. We used fMRI to determine differences in network activity associated with recently reactivated memories relative to comparably aged, non-reactivated memories. Reminders were effective in facilitating overall retrieval of memory for film clips, in an all-or-none fashion. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were activated during both reminders and retrieval. Peak activation in ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) preceded peak activation in the right hippocampus during the reminders. For film clips that were successfully retrieved after 7 days, pre-retrieval reminders did not enhance the quality of the retrieved memory or the number of details retrieved, nor did they more strongly engage regions of the recollection network than did successful retrieval of a non-reminded film clip. These results suggest that reminders prior to retrieval are an effective means of boosting retrieval of otherwise inaccessible episodic events, and that the inability to recall certain events after a delay of a week largely reflects a retrieval deficit, rather than a storage deficit for this information. The results extend other evidence that vPFC drives activation of the hippocampus to facilitate memory retrieval and scene construction, and show that this facilitation also occurs when reminder cues precede successful retrieval attempts. The time course of vPFC-hippocampal activity during the reminder suggests that reminders may first engage schematic information meditated by vPFC followed by a recollection process mediated by the hippocampus.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 32965760.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explored the possibility of predicting self-reported engagement ratings from neural activity and investigated the idiosyncratic effects of each phase of the dramatic arc on brain responses as well as the relationship between engagement and brain responses. We presented a movie excerpt following the six-phase narrative arc structure to female and male participants while collecting EEG signals. We then asked this group of participants to recall the excerpt, another group to segment the video based on the dramatic arc model, and a third to rate their engagement levels while watching the movie. The results showed that the self-reported engagement ratings followed the pattern of the narrative dramatic arc. Moreover, while EEG amplitude could not predict group-averaged engagement ratings, other features comprising dynamic intersubject correlation (dISC), including certain frequency bands, dynamic functional connectivity patterns and graph features were able to achieve this. Furthermore, neural activity in the last two phases of the dramatic arc significantly predicted engagement patterns. This study is the first to explore the cognitive processes behind the dramatic arc and its phases.

Finally, we tentatively suggest that recent developments in machine learning approaches may pave way for inferring different classes of inner experiences directly from the neuroimaging data, thus potentially complementing the behavioral self-reports.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:09:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35153706.0","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>!!

Factors such as facial expressions and body language affect our decisions in personal and professional life alike (1). These friend or foe judgements are often based on first impressions, which in turn may affect our decisions to approach or avoid. Previous studies investigating the neural correlates of social cognition tended to use static facial stimuli (2). Here, we illustrate an experimental design in which whole-body animated characters were used in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. Fifteen participants were presented with short movie-clips of guest-host interactions in a business setting, while fMRI data were recorded; at the end of each movie, participants also provided ratings of the host behaviour. This design mimics more closely real-life situations, and hence may contribute to better understanding of the neural mechanisms of social interactions in healthy behaviour, and to gaining insight into possible causes of deficits in social behaviour in such clinical conditions as social anxiety and autism","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 21775952.0","","","","fMRI; Modified Movie Stimulus; Neural Correlated of Social Cognition; Short Clips; Subjective Rating","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we test the novel hypothesis that the formation of narrative-based contextual representations in humans relies on the same hippocampal mechanisms that enable formation of spatiotemporal contexts in rodents. Participants watched a movie consisting of two interleaved narratives while we monitored their brain activity using fMRI. We used representational similarity analysis, a type of multivariate pattern analysis, which uses across-voxel correlations as a proxy for neural-pattern similarity, to examine whether the patterns of neural activity can be used to differentiate between narratives and recurring narrative elements, such as people and locations. We demonstrate that the neural activity patterns in the hippocampus differentiate between event nodes (people and locations) and narratives (different stories) and that these narrative-context representations diverge gradually over time akin to remapping-induced spatial maps represented by rodent place cells.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:09:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 27927958.0","","","","Event Boundaries; fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined whether such differential MPFC activity can be observed in children who are more fascinated by cartoons than adults. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while 10-year-old children watched movie and cartoon clips, simulating real and virtual visual worlds, respectively. We showed neuroimaging evidence that, in contrast to adults, the MPFC of children was activated when perceiving both human agents and artificial characters in coherent visual events.

In the present study, human brain activity was measured with adaptation functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate which brain areas support such audiovisual illusions. Subjects viewed trains of four movies beginning with three congruent /pa/ stimuli to induce adaptation. The fourth stimulus could be (i) another congruent /pa/, (ii) a congruent /ka/, (hi) an incongruent stimulus that evokes the McGurk effect in susceptible individuals (lips /ka/ voice /pa/), or (iv) the converse combination that does not cause the McGurk effect (lips /pa/ voice/ ka/). This paradigm was predicted to show increased release from adaptation (i.e. stronger brain activation) when the fourth movie and the related percept was increasingly different from the three previous movies. A stimulus change in either the auditory or the visual stimulus from /pa/ to /ka/ (iii, iv) produced within-modality and cross-modal responses in primary auditory and visual areas. A greater release from adaptation was observed for incongruent non-McGurk (iv) compared to incongruent McGurk (iii) trials. A network including the primary auditory and visual cortices, nonprimary auditory cortex, and several multisensory areas (superior temporal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, insula, and pre-central cortex) showed a correlation between perceiving the McGurk effect and the fMRI signal, suggesting that these areas support the audiovisual illusion.

This study employed inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis to investigate the neural basis of humor processing during free viewing of comedy movies in patients with schizophrenia. We recruited 29 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 29 healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. Each participant underwent fMRI scanning during two viewings of three comedy movie clips. The ISC map from each participant pair within each population group and each movie viewing was separately derived. The significance of ISC within a group and between two groups were assessed by bootstrapping. The ISC map from each patient pair were also correlated with the product of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) rating between the same participant pair in schizophrenia patients. Schizophrenia patients showed significant ISC in bilateral lateraloccipital, bilateral superior frontal, left supramarginal, and right lateralorbiofrontal cortices. Compared with the controls, the schizophrenia group exhibited significantly lower ISC in the left superior temporal sulcus, bilateral supramarginal, and bilateral inferiorparietal cortices. Higher clinical severity (higher total PANSS rating) was associated with lower ISC in the middle frontal and middle temporal regions, and also higher ISC in the visual cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulate. The findings indicated that patients with schizophrenia are characterized by lower ISC in a frontal parietal network while viewing comedy film clips, which implicated a deficit in the cognitive component of humor processing. The lower synchronization in parts of the frontal parietal network also correlated with symptom severity.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31484998.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Movie stimuli also evoke a richer variety of cognitive processes than traditional experiments, allowing the study of multiple aspects of brain development simultaneously. However, because these stimuli are uncontrolled, it is unclear how effectively distinct profiles of brain activity can be distinguished from the resulting data. Here we develop an approach for identifying multiple distinct subject-specific Regions of Interest (ssROIs) using fMRI data collected during movie-viewing. We focused on the test case of higher-level visual regions selective for faces, scenes, and objects. Adults (N = 13) were scanned while viewing a 5.6-min child-friendly movie, as well as a traditional localizer experiment with blocks of faces, scenes, and objects. We found that just 2.7 min of movie data could identify subject-specific face, scene, and object regions. While successful, movie-defined ssROIS still showed weaker domain selectivity than traditional ssROIs. Having validated our approach in adults, we then used the same methods on movie data collected from 3 to 12-year-old children (N = 122). Movie response timecourses in 3-year-old children's face, scene, and object regions were already significantly and specifically predicted by timecourses from the corresponding regions in adults. We also found evidence of continued developmental change, particularly in the face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus. Taken together, our results reveal both early maturity and functional change in face, scene, and object regions, and more broadly highlight the promise of short, child-friendly movies for developmental cognitive neuroscience.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35274789.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, individual differences have been attracting increasing attention in search of group differences or associations with behavioral outcomes. Individual differences are typically studied by directly modeling the pair-wise intersubject correlation matrix or projecting the relations onto a single dimension. We contend that it is critical to examine whether there are one or more consistent responses underlying the whole sample, because multiple components, if exist, may undermine the intersubject relations using the previous methods. We propose to use principal component analysis (PCA) to examine the heterogeneity of brain responses across subjects and project the individual variability into higher dimensions. By analyzing an fMRI dataset of children and adults watching a cartoon movie, we showed evidence of two consistent responses in the supramarginal gyrus and other regions. While the first components in many regions represented a response pattern mostly in older children and adults, the second components mainly represented the younger children. The second components in the supramarginal network resembled a delayed version of the first PCs for 4 s (2 TR), indicating slower responses in the younger children than the older children and adults. The analyses highlight the importance of identifying multiple consistent responses in responses to naturalistic stimuli. This PCA-based approach could be complementary to the commonly used intersubject correlation to analyze movie-watching data.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35586919.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While dynamic switches between brain states have been well characterised in resting state acquisitions, the remodelling of these state transitions by engagement in naturalistic stimuli remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the temporal dynamics of brain states, as measured in fMRI, are reshaped from predominantly bistable transitions between two relatively indistinct states at rest, toward a sequence of well-defined functional states during movie viewing whose transitions are temporally aligned to specific features of the movie. The expression of these brain states covaries with different physiological states and reflects subjectively rated engagement in the movie. In sum, a data-driven decoding of brain states reveals the distinct reshaping of functional network expression and reliable state transitions that accompany the switch from resting state to perceptual immersion in an ecologically valid sensory experience. The transition from resting to perceiving one's milieu requires a fundamental reorganization of brain activity. Here, the authors show how a fundamental reshaping of brain state dynamics supports perceptual engagement in naturalistic stimuli.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33020473.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While several neural and psychological risk factors are known, no post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) biomarker has yet progressed to clinical use. Here we present novel and clinically applicable anger-related neurobehavioral risk markers for military-related PTSS in a large cohort of Israeli soldiers. The psychological, electrophysiological and neural (Simultaneous recording of scalp electroencephalography [EEG] and functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) reaction to an anger-inducing film were measured prior to advanced military training and PTSS were recorded at 1-year follow-up. Limbic modulation was measured using a novel approach that monitors amygdala modulation using fMRI-inspired EEG, hereafter termed amygdala electrical fingerprint (amyg-EFP). Inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis on fMRI data indicated that during movie viewing participants' brain activity was synchronized in limbic regions including the amygdala. Self-reported state-anger and amyg-EFP modulation successfully predicted PTSS levels. State-anger significantly accounted for 20% of the variance in PTSS, and amyg-EFP signal modulation significantly accounted for additional 15% of the variance. Our study was limited by the moderate PTSS levels and lack of systematic baseline symptoms assessment. These results suggest that pre-stress neurobehavioral measures of anger may predict risk for later PTSS, pointing to anger-related vulnerability factors that can be measured efficiently and at a low cost before stress exposure. Possible mechanisms underlying the association between the anger response and risk for PTSS are discussed.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 28326027.0","","","","Disorder Characterization w/ ISC; EEG/MEG; fMRI; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, studies combining fMRI recordings of brain activity during, trauma film viewing with assessment of female sex hormones are missing. The trauma film paradigm - a widely used experimental analogue for trauma exposure confronts healthy participants with traumatic film clips and thus allows studying peritraumatic processing under laboratory conditions. Following this paradigm, the current fMRI study examined the role of endogenous estradiol and synthetic sex hormones for the neural processing of traumatic (i.e., depicting interpersonal violence) vs. neutral films in 53 healthy women (mean age 22.3 years; 23 using hormonal contraception, HC). As predicted, traumatic films strongly activated areas of the fear processing network, such as amygdala, insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Estradiol levels in women not using HC were positively correlated with ventromedial prefrontal activity. Furthermore, women using HC as compared to women without HC demonstrated heightened insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activity during traumatic film viewing. These experimental results highlight the effects of both gonadal hormone status and HC intake on peritraumatic processing in neural regions relevant for emotion generation and regulation that have been found to be abnormal in PTSD.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29032323.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent advances in EPI speed have been made possible with simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) methods which combine acceleration factors M from multiband (MB) radiofrequency pulses and S from simultaneous image refocusing (SIR) to acquire a total of N = S x M images in one echo train, providing up to N times speed-up in total acquisition time over conventional EPI. We evaluated accelerations as high as N = 48 using different combinations of S and M which allow for whole brain imaging in as little as 100 ms at 3 T with a 32 channel head coil. The various combinations of acceleration parameters were evaluated by tSNR as well as BOLD contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and information content from checkerboard and movie clips in fMRI experiments. We found that at low acceleration factors (N = 6), setting S = 1 and varying M alone yielded the best results in all evaluation metrics, while at acceleration N = 8 the results were mixed using both S = 1 and S = 2 sequences. At higher acceleration factors (N N 8), using S = 2 yielded maximal BOLD CNR and information content as measured by classification of movie clip frames. Importantly, we found significantly greater BOLD information content using relatively fast TRs in the range of 300 ms-600ms compared to a TR of 2 s, suggesting that faster TRs capture more information per unit time in task based fMRI.

Here, we tackled this question implementing a prism adaptation-like training in virtual reality (VRPA) in combination with functional neuroimaging. Three groups of healthy participants (N = 45) underwent VRPA (with a shift either to the left/right side, or with no shift), and performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions before and after training. To capture modulations in free-flowing, task-free brain activity, the fMRI sessions included resting-state and free-viewing of naturalistic videos. We found significant decreases in spontaneous functional connectivity between attentional and default mode (DMN)/fronto-parietal networks, only for the adaptation groups, more pronouncedly in the hemisphere contralateral to the induced shift. In addition, VRPA was found to bias visual responses to naturalistic videos: Following rightward adaptation, we found upregulation of visual response in an area in the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) only in the right hemisphere. Notably, the extent of POS upregulation correlated with the size of the VRPA-induced after-effect measured in behavioral tests. This study demonstrates that a brief VRPA exposure can change large-scale cortical connectivity and correspondingly bias visual responses to naturalistic sensory inputs.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 36288926.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current models of memory updating propose that people must first generate memory-based predictions to detect and register that features of the environment have changed, then encode the new event features and integrate them with relevant memories of past experiences to form configural memory representations. Each of these steps may be impaired in older adults. Using functional MRI, we investigated these mechanisms in healthy young and older adults. In the scanner, participants first watched a movie depicting everyday activities in a day of an actor's life. They next watched a second nearly identical movie in which some scenes ended differently. Crucially, before watching the last part of each activity, the second movie stopped, and participants were asked to mentally replay how the activity previously ended. Three days later, participants were asked to recall the activities. Neural activity pattern reinstatement in medial temporal lobe (MTL) during the replay phase of the second movie was associated with detecting changes and with better memory for the original activity features. Reinstatements in posterior medial cortex (PMC) additionally predicted better memory for changed features. Compared to young adults, older adults showed a reduced ability to detect and remember changes and weaker associations between reinstatement and memory performance. These findings suggest that PMC and MTL contribute to change processing by reinstating previous event features, and that older adults are less able to use reinstatement to update memory for changed features.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33229530.0","","","","fMRI; Modified Movie Stimulus; Movie Recalling; OUT-OF-SCOPE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that attention plays an important role in crossmodal integration. In this study, we considered crossmodal integration in audiovisual facial perception and explored its effect on the neural representation of features. The audiovisual stimuli in the experiment consisted of facial movie clips that could be classified into 2 gender categories (male vs. female) or 2 emotion categories (crying vs. laughing). The visual/auditory-only stimuli were created from these movie clips by removing the auditory/visual contents. The subjects needed to make a judgment about the gender/emotion category for each movie clip in the audiovisual, visual-only, or auditory-only stimulus condition as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals were recorded. The neural representation of the gender/emotion feature was assessed using the decoding accuracy and the brain pattern-related reproducibility indices, obtained by a multivariate pattern analysis method from the fMRI data.

Arousal and valence were associated with hemodynamic activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing, including amygdala, thalamus, and superior temporal sulcus. Cerebral MOR availability correlated negatively with the hemodynamic responses to arousing scenes in amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus, whereas no positive correlations were observed in any brain region. D2R availability-here reliably quantified only in striatum-was not associated with either arousal or valence.

However, mixed emotional states (e.g., the co-occurrence of amusement and disgust, or sadness and pleasure) are common in everyday life. Psychophysiological and behavioral evidence suggests that mixed emotions may have response profiles that are distinguishable from their constituent emotions. Yet, the brain bases of mixed emotions remain unresolved.Methods: We recruited 38 healthy adults who viewed short, validated film clips, eliciting either positive (amus-ing), negative (disgusting), neutral, or mixed (a mix of amusement and disgust) emotional states, while brain ac-tivity was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We assessed mixed emotions in two ways: first by comparing neural reactivity to ambiguous (mixed) with that to unambiguous (positive and negative) film clips and second by conducting parametric analyses to measure neural reactivity with respect to individual emo-tional states. We thus obtained self-reports of amusement and disgust after each clip and computed a minimum feeling score (shared minimum of amusement and disgust) to quantify mixed emotional feelings.Results: Both analyses revealed a network of the posterior cingulate (PCC), medial superior parietal lobe (SPL)/precuneus, and parieto-occipital sulcus to be involved in ambiguous contexts eliciting mixed emotions.Conclusion: Our results are the first to shed light on the dedicated neural processes involved in dynamic social ambiguity processing. They suggest both higher-order (SPL) and lower-order (PCC) processes may be needed to process emotionally complex social scenes.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 36848968.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What has remained unclear is whether specialization also shapes brain networks underlying mental imagery. In our fMRI study, we aimed to uncover modality-specific mental imagery specialization of film experts. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis we decoded from brain activity of professional cinematographers and sound designers whether they were imagining sounds or images of particular film clips. In each expert group distinct multi-voxel patterns, specific for the modality of their expertise, were found during classification of imagery modality. These patterns were mainly localized in the occipito-temporal and parietal cortex for cinematographers and in the auditory cortex for sound designers. We also found generalized patterns across perception and imagery that were distinct for the two expert groups: they involved frontal cortex for the cinematographers and temporal cortex for the sound designers. Notably, the mental representations of film clips and sounds of cinematographers contained information that went beyond modality-specificity. We were able to successfully decode the implicit presence of film genre from brain activity during mental imagery in cinematographers. The results extend existing neuroimaging literature on expertise into the domain of mental imagery and show that experience in visual versus auditory imagery can alter the representation of information in modality-specific association cortices.

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have modeled brain activity elicited by static visual patterns and have reconstructed these patterns from brain activity [6-8]. However, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals measured via fMRI are very slow [9], so it has been difficult to model brain activity elicited by dynamic stimuli such as natural movies. Here we present a new motion-energy [10, 11] encoding model that largely overcomes this limitation. The model describes fast visual information and slow hemodynamics by separate components. We recorded BOLD signals in occipitotemporal visual cortex of human subjects who watched natural movies and fit the model separately to individual voxels. Visualization of the fit models reveals how early visual areas represent the information in movies. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we also constructed a Bayesian decoder [8] by combining estimated encoding models with a sampled natural movie prior. The decoder provides remarkable reconstructions of the viewed movies. These results demonstrate that dynamic brain activity measured under naturalistic conditions can be decoded using current fMRI technology.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 21945275.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This occurs, for example, when stimuli processed via one sensory modality imply features characteristic of a different modality; for instance, visual stimuli that imply touch have been observed to activate the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). In the present study, we addressed the question of whether such cross-modal activations are content specific. To this end, we investigated neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortex of subjects who observed human hands engaged in the haptic exploration of different everyday objects. Using multivariate pattern analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we were able to predict, based exclusively on the activity pattern in SI, which of several objects a subject saw being explored. Along with previous studies that found similar evidence for other modalities, our results suggest that primary sensory cortices represent information relevant for their modality even when this information enters the brain via a different sensory system.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 21330469.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, attribution of animacy does not occur under all circumstances and the precise conditions under which specific regions are activated remains unclear. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study we manipulated viewers' perspective to assess the part played by selective attention.

Activations that occurred to the initial cue, while observing the animations themselves and while responding to a postpresentation probe, were analyzed separately. Results showed that activity in the social brain network was strongly influenced by selective attention, and that remarkably similar activations were seen during film viewing and in response to probe questions.

Recent human imaging studies demonstrated that activity in some cortical regions, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula cortex (aIC), is related to sympathetic activity. However, little is known about the functional brain connectivity related to sympathetic response to fearful stimuli. The participants were 32 healthy, right-handed volunteers. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine brain activity when watching horror and control movies. Fingertip temperature was taken during the scanning as a measure of sympathetic response. The movies were watched a second time, and the degree of fear (9-point Likert-type scale) was evaluated every three seconds. The brain activity of the ACC, bilateral aIC, and bilateral anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) was correlated with the change rate of fingertip temperature, with or without fearful stimuli. Functional connectivity analysis revealed significantly greater positive functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ACC and between the amygdala and the aIC when watching the horror movie than when watching the control movie. Whole-brain psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed that the functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the ACC was modulated according to the fear rating. Our results indicate that the increased functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the ACC represents a sympathetic response to fearful stimuli. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Despite theoretical conceptions of narrative engagement as emotion-laden attention, little empirical work has characterized the cognitive and neural processes that comprise subjective engagement in naturalistic contexts or its consequences for memory. Here, we relate fluctuations in narrative engagement to patterns of brain coactivation and test whether neural signatures of engagement predict subsequent memory. In behavioral studies, participants continuously rated how engaged they were as they watched a television episode or listened to a story. Self-reported engagement was synchronized across individuals and driven by the emotional content of the narratives. In functional MRI datasets collected as different individuals watched the same show or listened to the same story, engagement drove neural synchrony, such that default mode network activity was more synchronized across individuals during more engaging moments of the narratives. Furthermore, models based on time-varying functional brain connectivity predicted evolving states of engagement across participants and independent datasets. The functional connections that predicted engagement overlapped with a validated neuromarker of sustained attention and predicted recall of narrative events. Together, our findings characterize the neural signatures of attentional engagement in naturalistic contexts and elucidate relationships among narrative engagement, sustained attention, and event memory.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 34385312.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"QWTTIQ5T","journalArticle","","Sawahata Yasuhito, Komine Kazuteru","Decoding Humor Experiences from Brain Activity of People Viewing Comedy Movies","","","","10.1371/journal.pone.0081009","","Humans naturally have a sense of humor. Experiencing humor not only encourages social interactions, but also produces positive physiological effects on the human body, such as lowering blood pressure. Recent neuro-imaging studies have shown evidence for distinct mental state changes at work in people experiencing humor. However, the temporal characteristics of these changes remain elusive. In this paper, we objectively measured humor-related mental states from single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained while subjects viewed comedy TV programs. Measured fMRI data were labeled on the basis of the lag before or after the viewer's perception of humor (humor onset) determined by the viewer-reported humor experiences during the fMRI scans. We trained multiple binary classifiers, or decoders, to distinguish between fMRI data obtained at each lag from ones obtained during a neutral state in which subjects were not experiencing humor. As a result, in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right temporal area, the decoders showed significant classification accuracies even at two seconds ahead of the humor onsets. Furthermore, given a time series of fMRI data obtained during movie viewing, we found that the decoders with significant performance were also able to predict the upcoming humor events on a volume-by-volume basis. Taking into account the hemodynamic delay, our results suggest that the upcoming humor events are encoded in specific brain areas up to about five seconds before the awareness of experiencing humor. Our results provide evidence that there exists a mental state lasting for a few seconds before actual humor perception, as if a viewer is expecting the future humorous events.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 24324656.0","","","","Anticipation of Event Boundaries; Continuous Self-Reporting; Decoding Emotional Dimensions; Event Boundaries; fMRI; Neural Correlates of Shared Conscious Experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interruptions that require switching of attention to other event sequences disrupt this process. To reveal neural mechanisms supporting integration of event information, we measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from 18 participants while they viewed 6.5-minute excerpts from three movies (i) consecutively and (ii) as interleaved segments of approximately 50-s in duration. We measured inter-subject reliability of brain activity by calculating inter-subject correlations (ISC) of fMRI signals and analyzed activation timecourses with a general linear model (GLM). Interleaving decreased the ISC in posterior temporal lobes, medial prefrontal cortex, superior precuneus, medial occipital cortex, and cerebellum. In the GLM analyses, posterior temporal lobes were activated more consistently by instances of speech when the movies were viewed consecutively than as interleaved segments. By contrast, low-level auditory and visual stimulus features and editing boundaries caused similar activity patterns in both conditions. In the medial occipital cortex, decreases in ISC were seen in short bursts throughout the movie clips. By contrast, the other areas showed longer-lasting differences in ISC during isolated scenes depicting socially-relevant and suspenseful content, such as deception or inter-subject conflict. The areas in the posterior temporal lobes also showed sustained activity during continuous actions and were deactivated when actions ended at scene boundaries. Our results suggest that the posterior temporal and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, as well as the cerebellum and dorsal precuneus, support integration of events into coherent event sequences.

Disrupted brain networks may underlie the inability to effectively disengage from interoceptive signals in this disorder. This study investigates changes in effective connectivity between cortical systems supporting attention, interoception, and perception in those with melancholic depression when shifting attention from rest to viewing dynamic film stimuli. We hypothesised that those with melancholia would show impaired attentional shifting from rest to emotional film viewing, captured in neuronal states that differed little across conditions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 48 participants (16 melancholic depressed, 16 non-melancholic depressed, and 16 healthy controls) at rest and whilst viewing emotionally salient movies. Using independent component analysis, we identified 8 cortical modes (default mode, executive control, left/right frontoparietal attention, left/right insula, visual and auditory) and studied their dynamics using dynamic causal modelling. Engagement with dynamic emotional material diminished in melancholia and was associated with network-wide increases in effective connectivity. Melancholia was also characterised by an increase in effective connectivity amongst cortical regions involved in attention and interoception when shifting from rest to negative film viewing, with the converse pattern in control participants. The observed involvement of attention-and insula-based cortical systems highlights a potential neurobiological mechanism for disrupted attentional resource allocation, particularly in switching between interoceptive and exteroceptive signals, in melancholia.

Here we propose inter-subject correlation (ISC) maps as stimulus-sensitive functional templates for sorting the independent components (ICs) to identify the most stimulus-related networks without stimulus-dependent temporal covariates. We collected 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during perception of continuous audiovisual speech. Ten adults viewed a video, in which speech intelligibility was varied by altering the sound level. Five ICs with strongest overlap with the ISC map comprised auditory and visual cortices, and the sixth was a left-hemisphere-dominant network (left posterior superior temporal sulcus, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior superior temporal pole, supplementary motor cortex, and right angular gyrus) that was activated stronger during soft than loud speech. Corresponding temporal-model-based analysis revealed only temporal- and parietal-lobe activations without involvement of the anterior areas. The performance of the ISC-based IC selection was confirmed with fMRI data collected during free viewing of movie. Since ISC-ICA requires no predetermined temporal models on stimulus timing, it seems feasible for fMRI studies where hemodynamic variations are difficult to model because of the complex temporal structure of the naturalistic stimulation.

Thanks to a rigorous thresholding process, significant changes in inter-subject functional correlation can be extracted and analyzed.On a set of healthy subjects who underwent naturalistic audio-visual stimulation, we demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by tying the unraveled functional reconfigurations to particular cues of the movie.

Here we show that the cerebral cortex can also be subdivided into different components temporally, without any a priori hypotheses, based on the principle of functional independence. This states that distinct functional subdivisions have activity time courses (ATCs) that are, if not independent, at least characteristic to each when the brain is exposed to natural conditions. To approach a time-based anatomy experimentally, we recorded whole-brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and analyzed the data with independent component analysis (ICA). Our results show that a multitude of cortical areas can be identified based purely on their characteristic ATCs during natural conditions. We demonstrate that a more 'rich' stimulation (free viewing of a movie) leads to more areas being activated in a specific way than conventional stimuli, allowing for a more detailed dissection of the cortex into its subdivisions. We show that stimulus-driven functionally specialized areas can be identified by intersubject correlation even if their function is unknown. Chronoarchitectonic mapping thus opens the prospect of identifying previously unknown cortical subdivisions based on natural viewing conditions by exploiting the characteristic temporal 'fingerprint' that is unique to each.

In real life, events eliciting this kind of vicarious brain activations are intermingled with other complex, ever-changing stimuli in the environment. One practical approach to study the neural underpinnings of real-life vicarious perception is to image brain activity during movie viewing. Here the goal was to find out how observed haptic events in a silent movie would affect the spectator's sensorimotor cortex. The functional state of the sensorimotor cortex was monitored by analyzing, in 16 healthy subjects, magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to tactile finger stimuli that were presented once per second throughout the session. Using canonical correlation analysis and spatial filtering, consistent single-trial responses across subjects were uncovered, and their waveform changes throughout the movie were quantified. The long-latency (85-175 ms) parts of the responses were modulated in concordance with the participants' average moment-by-moment ratings of own engagement in the haptic content of the movie (correlation r=0.49; ratings collected after the MEG session). The results, obtained by using novel signal-analysis approaches, demonstrate that the functional state of the human sensorimotor cortex fluctuates in a fine-grained manner even during passive observation of temporally varying haptic events.

Using an experimental design modeled after previous studies that used scrambled versions of a spoken story (Lerner et al., 2011) and a silent movie (Hasson et al., 2008), we investigate whether listeners perceive hierarchical structure in music beyond short (similar to 6 s) time windows and whether there is cortical overlap between music and language processing at multiple timescales. Experienced pianists were presented with an extended musical excerpt scrambled at multiple timescales by measure, phrase, and section while measuring brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The reliability of evoked activity, as quantified by inter-subject correlation of the fMRI responses, was measured. We found that response reliability depended systematically on musical structure coherence, revealing a topographically organized hierarchy of processing timescales. Early auditory areas (at the bottom of the hierarchy) responded reliably in all conditions. For brain areas at the top of the hierarchy, the original (unscrambled) excerpt evoked more reliable responses than any of the scrambled excerpts, indicating that these brain areas process long-timescale musical structures, on the order of minutes. The topography of processing timescales was analogous with that reported previously for speech, but the timescale gradients for music and speech overlapped with one another only partially, suggesting that temporally analogous structures words/measures, sentences/musical phrases, paragraph/sections are processed separately.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 26029037.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This anticipation varied hierarchically in a posterior (less anticipation) to anterior (more anticipation) fashion. We also identified specific regions in which the timing of the brain's event boundaries was related to those of human-labeled event boundaries, with the timing of this relationship shifting on repeated viewings. With repeated viewing, the brain's event boundaries came to precede human-annotated boundaries by 1-4 s on average.

The high rate of recurrence of MDD suggests the presence of stable vulnerability factors that place individuals with a history of major depression at an increased risk for the onset of another episode. Previous research has linked the remitted state, and therefore increased vulnerability for depressive relapse, with difficulties in the use of pleasant autobiographical memories to repair sad mood. In the present study, we examined the neural correlates of these difficulties. Groups of 16 currently euthymic, remitted depressed individuals and 16 healthy (control) women underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during sad mood induction and during recovery from a sad mood state through recall of mood-incongruent positive autobiographical memories. Sad mood was induced in participants by using film clips; participants then recalled positive autobiographical memories, a procedure previously shown to repair negative affect. During both the sad mood induction and automatic mood regulation, control participants exhibited activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and cuneus; in contrast, remitted participants exhibited a decrease in activation in these regions. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that reduced activation levels during mood regulation predicted a worsening of depressive symptoms at a 20-month follow-up assessment. These findings highlight a dynamic role of the vlPFC and cuneus in the experience and modulation of emotional states and suggest that functional anomalies of these brain regions are associated with a history of, and vulnerability to, depression.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 24146315.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relationships between these signals have been established in the context of specific tasks or during resting state, often using spatially confined concurrent recordings in animals. But it is not certain whether these correlations generalize to other contexts relevant for human cognitive neuroscience. Here, we address the case of complex naturalistic stimuli and ask two basic questions. First, how reliable are the responses evoked by a naturalistic audio-visual stimulus in each of these imaging methods, and second, how similar are stimulus-related responses across methods? To this end, we investigated a wide range of brain regions and frequency bands. We presented the same movie clip twice to three different cohorts of subjects (N-EEG = 45, N-fMRI = 11, N-ECoG = 5) and assessed stimulus-driven correlations across viewings and between imaging methods, thereby ruling out task-irrelevant confounds. All three imaging methods had similar repeat-reliability across viewings when fMRI and EEG data were averaged across subjects, highlighting the potential to achieve large signal-to-noise ratio by leveraging large sample sizes. The fMRI signal correlated positively with high-frequency ECoG power across multiple task-related cortical structures but positively with low-frequency EEG and ECoG power. In contrast to previous studies, these correlations were as strong for low-frequency as for high frequency ECoG. We also observed links between fMRI and infra-slow EEG voltage fluctuations. These results extend previous findings to the case of natural stimulus processing.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:12:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29902585.0","","","","EEG/MEG; fMRI; Intra; Short Clips","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings and single-cell recordings from the human insula while seven epilepsy patients rated the intensity of a woman's painful experiences seen in short movie clips. Pain had to be deduced from seeing facial expressions or a hand being slapped by a belt. We found activity in the broadband 20-190 Hz range correlated with the trial-by-trial perceived intensity in the insula for both types of stimuli. Within the insula, some locations had activity correlating with perceived intensity for our facial expressions but not for our hand stimuli, others only for our hand but not our face stimuli, and others for both. The timing of responses to the sight of the hand being hit is best explained by kinematic information; that for our facial expressions, by shape information. Comparing the broadband activity in the iEEG signal with spiking activity from a small number of neurons and an fMRI experiment with similar stimuli revealed a consistent spatial organization, with stronger associations with intensity more anteriorly, while viewing the hand being slapped.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 36326213.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on established finite impulse response (FIR) analysis methodology we show how spatiotemporal statistical parametric maps may be concatenated to form Brain Activation Movies (BAMs), dynamic activation maps representing the temporal evolution of brain activation throughout task performance. These BAMs enable comprehensive assessment of the dynamics in functional topology without restriction to predefined regions and without detailed information on the stimulus paradigm. We apply BAM visualization to two fMRI studies demonstrating the additional spatiotemporal information available compared to standard fMRI result presentation. Here we show that BAMs allow for unbiased data visualization providing dynamic activation maps without assumptions on the neural activity except reproducibility across trials. It may thus be useful in proceeding from static to dynamic brain mapping, widening the range of fMRI in neuroscience. In addition, BAMs might be helpful tools in visualizing the temporal evolution of activation in real-time for better and intuitive understanding of temporal processes in the human brain.

Here, we adopted a novel inter-subject correlation (inter-SC) and intra-subject correlation (intra-SC) technique to quantify the reliability of the spatio-temporal responses of functional MR activity in adults with autism during free-viewing of a popular audio-visual movie. Whereas these complex stimuli evoke highly reliable shared response time courses in typical individuals, cortical activity was more variable across individuals with autism (low inter-SC). Interestingly, when we measured the responses within an autistic individual across repeated presentations of the movie, we observed a unique, idiosyncratic response time course that was reliably replicated within each individual (high intra-SC). Encouragingly, after filtering out the idiosyncratic responses from each individual time course, we were able to uncover a more typical response profile, which resembles the shared responses seen in the typical subjects. These findings indicate that, under conditions approximating real-life situations, the neural activity of individuals with autism is characterized by individualistic responses that, although reliable within an autistic individual, are both highly variable across autistic individuals and different from the responses observed within the typical subjects. These idiosyncratic responses may underlie the atypical behaviors observed in autism. At the same time, we are encouraged by the presence of the more typical activation pattern lurking beneath these idiosyncratic fluctuations. Taken together, these findings may pave the way to future research aimed at characterizing the idiosyncratic response profiles, which, in turn, might contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneity of the autism spectrum and its diagnosis.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 19708061.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since impaired emotion regulation contributes to disturbed emotion functioning in BPD, it is crucial to study underlying neural activity. The current study aimed at investigating the neural correlates of two emotion regulation strategies, namely emotion acceptance and suppression, which are both important treatment targets in BPD. MethodsTwenty-one women with BPD and 23 female healthy control participants performed an emotion regulation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While watching fearful movie clips, participants were instructed to either accept or to suppress upcoming emotions compared to passive viewing. ResultsResults revealed acceptance-related insular underactivation and suppression-related caudate overactivation in subjects with BPD during the emotion regulation task. ConclusionThis is a first study on the neural correlates of emotion acceptance and suppression in BPD. Altered insula functioning during emotion acceptance may reflect impairments in emotional awareness in BPD. Increased caudate activity is linked to habitual motor and cognitive processes and therefore may accord to the well-established routine in BPD patients to suppress emotional experiences.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 36704727.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we showed a feature film to 10 healthy volunteers during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of hemodynamic brain activity. We then annotated auditory and visual features of the motion picture to inform analysis of the hemodynamic data. The annotations were fitted to both voxel-wise data and brain network time courses extracted by independent component analysis (ICA). Auditory annotations correlated with two independent components (IC) disclosing two functional networks, one responding to variety of auditory stimulation and another responding preferentially to speech but parts of the network also responding to non-verbal communication. Visual feature annotations correlated with four ICs delineating visual areas according to their sensitivity to different visual stimulus features. In comparison, a separate voxel-wise general linear model based analysis disclosed brain areas preferentially responding to sound energy, speech, music, visual contrast edges, body motion and hand motion which largely overlapped the results revealed by ICA. Differences between the results of IC- and voxel-based analyses demonstrate that thorough analysis of voxel time courses is important for understanding the activity of specific sub-areas of the functional networks, while ICA is a valuable tool for revealing novel information about functional connectivity which need not be explained by the predefined model. Our results encourage the use of naturalistic stimuli and tasks in cognitive neuroimaging to study how the brain processes stimuli in rich natural environments.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 22496909.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants viewed a 50-min movie, then verbally described the events during functional MRI, producing unguided detailed descriptions lasting up to 40 min. As each person spoke, event-specific spatial patterns were reinstated in default-network, medial-temporal, and high-level visual areas. Individual event patterns were both highly discriminable from one another and similar among people, suggesting consistent spatial organization. In many high-order areas, patterns were more similar between people recalling the same event than between recall and perception, indicating systematic reshaping of percept into memory. These results reveal the existence of a common spatial organization for memories in highlevel cortical areas, where encoded information is largely abstracted beyond sensory constraints, and that neural patterns during perception are altered systematically across people into shared memory representations for real-life events.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 27918531.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As conventional experimental tasks lack this type of everyday complexity, we administered a film-based multi-talker condition with auditory distractors in the background. ADHD-related aberrant brain responses to this naturalistic stimulus were identified using intersubject correlations (ISCs) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from 51 adults with ADHD and 29 healthy controls. A novel permutation-based approach introducing studentized statistics and subject-wise voxel-level null-distributions revealed that several areas in cerebral attention networks and sensory cortices were desynchronized in participants with ADHD (n ¼ 20) relative to healthy controls (n ¼ 20). Specifically, desynchronization of the posterior parietal cortex occurred when irrelevant speech or music was presented in the background, but not when irrelevant white noise was presented, or when there were no distractors. We also show regionally distinct ISC signatures for inattention and impulsivity. Finally, post-scan recall of the film contents was associated with stronger ISCs in the default-mode network for the ADHD and in the dorsal attention network for healthy controls. The present study shows that ISCs can further our understanding of how a complex environment influences brain states in ADHD.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:08:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31730921.0","","C:\Users\Etudiant\Zotero\storage\4RZVKYDH\Salmi Juha - ADHD desynchronizes brain activity during watching.pdf","","Disorder Characterization w/ ISC; fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subjects were 100 non-convicted well-functioning individuals, 19 violent male offenders, and 19 matched controls. Subjects underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and viewed movie clips with varying violent content during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Psychopathic traits were evaluated with Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (controls) and Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (offenders). Psychopathic offenders had lower gray matter density (GMD) in orbitofrontal cortex and anterior insula. In the community sample, affective psychopathy traits were associated with lower GMD in the same areas. Viewing violence increased brain activity in periaqueductal grey matter, thalamus, somatosensory, premotor, and temporal cortices. Psychopathic offenders had increased responses to violence in thalamus and orbitofrontal, insular, and cingulate cortices. In the community sample, impulsivity-related psychopathy traits were positively associated with violence-elicited responses in similar areas. We conclude that brain characteristics underlying psychopathic spectrum in violent psychopathy are related to those observed in well-functioning individuals with asocial personality features.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:09:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33834203.0","","","","Disorder Characterization w/ ISC; fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The activations and networks evoked by musical imagery were compared with those elicited by the subjects directly listening to the same music. Musical imagery and musical perception resulted in overlapping activations at the anterolateral belt and Wernicke's area, where the responses were correlated with the auditory features of the music. Whereas Wernicke's area interacted within the intrinsic auditory network during musical perception, it was involved in much more complex networks during musical imagery, showing positive correlations with the dorsal attention network and the motor-control network and negative correlations with the default-mode network.

However, these experimental settings bear little resemblance to our real-life experience in day-to-day interactions with the surroundings. To address this issue, neuroscientists have been measuring brain activity under natural viewing experiments in which the subjects are given continuous stimuli, such as watching a movie or listening to a story. The main challenge with this approach is that the measured signal consists of both the stimulus-induced signal, as well as intrinsic-neural and nonneuronal signals. By exploiting the experimental design, we propose to estimate stimulus-locked brain networks by treating nonstimulus-induced signals as nuisance parameters. In many neuroscience applications, it is often important to identify brain regions that are connected to many other brain regions during cognitive process. We propose an inferential method to test whether the maximum degree of the estimated network is larger than a prespecific number. We prove that the type I error can be controlled and that the power increases to one asymptotically. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of our method. Finally, we analyze a functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset obtained under the Sherlock Holmes movie stimuli.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:10:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 32413154.0","","","","Event Boundaries; fMRI; Functional Connectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"5JXBC9Q3","journalArticle","","Matsumoto Yukiko, Nishida Satoshi","Disorganization of Semantic Brain Networks in Schizophrenia Revealed by fMRI","","","","10.1093/schbul/sbac157","","Objectives Schizophrenia is a mental illness that presents with thought disorders including delusions and disorganized speech. Thought disorders have been regarded as a consequence of the loosening of associations between semantic concepts since the term schizophrenia was first coined by Bleuler. However, a mechanistic account of this cardinal disturbance in terms of functional dysconnection has been lacking. To evaluate how aberrant semantic connections are expressed through brain activity, we characterized large-scale network structures of concept representations using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Study Design We quantified various concept representations in patients' brains from fMRI activity evoked by movie scenes using encoding modeling. We then constructed semantic brain networks by evaluating the similarity of these semantic representations and conducted graph theory-based network analyses. Study Results Neurotypical networks had small-world properties similar to those of natural languages, suggesting small-worldness as a universal property in semantic knowledge networks. Conversely, small-worldness was significantly reduced in networks of schizophrenia patients and was correlated with psychological measures of delusions. Patients' semantic networks were partitioned into more distinct categories and had more random within-category structures than those of controls. Conclusions The differences in conceptual representations manifest altered semantic clustering and associative intrusions that underlie thought disorders. This is the first study to provide pathophysiological evidence for the loosening of associations as reflected in randomization of semantic networks in schizophrenia. Our method provides a promising approach for understanding the neural basis of altered or creative inner experiences of individuals with mental illness or exceptional abilities, respectively.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 36542452.0","","","","Disorder Characterization w/ ISC; fMRI; Functional Connectivity; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Neural Correlates of Shared Conscious Experience; Predicting Neural Corr. w/ Encoding Models; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the extent to which these patients retain internal awareness remains unknown. To investigate the potential for internal and external awareness in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness (DoC), we asked whether the pattern of juxtaposition between the functional time-courses of the default mode (DMN) and fronto-parietal networks, shown in healthy individuals to mediate the naturally occurring dominance switching between internal and external aspects of consciousness, was present in these patients. We used a highly engaging movie by Alfred Hitchcock to drive the recruitment of the fronto-parietal networks, including the dorsal attention (DAN) and executive control (ECN) networks, and their maximal juxtaposition to the DMN in response to the complex stimulus, relative to rest and a scrambled, meaningless movie baseline condition. We tested a control group of healthy participants (N = 13/12) and two groups of patients with disorders of consciousness, one comprised of patients who demonstrated independent, neuroimaging-based evidence of covert external awareness (N = 8), and the other of those who did not (N = 8). Similarly to the healthy controls, only the group of patients with overt and, critically, covert external awareness showed significantly heightened differentiation between the DMN and the DAN in response to movie viewing relative to their resting state time-courses, which was driven by the movie's narrative. This result suggested the presence of functional integrity in the DMN and fronto-parietal networks and their relationship to one another in patients with covert external awareness. Similar to the effect in healthy controls, these networks became more strongly juxtaposed to one another in response to movie viewing relative to the baseline conditions, suggesting the potential for internal and external awareness during complex stimulus processing. Furthermore, our results suggest that naturalistic paradigms can dissociate between groups of DoC patients with and without covert awareness based on the functional integrity of brain networks.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:09:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29997565.0","<p>Movie BANG!</p>","","","Disorder Characterization w/ ISC; fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neural Correlates of Genital Arousal: An Infrared Thermographic and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Sexual Arousal in Men and Women","","","","10.1016/j.jsxm.2017.12.006","","Background: The few studies that have examined the neural correlates of genital arousal have focused on men and are methodologically hard to compare.Aim: To investigate the neural correlates of peripheral physiologic sexual arousal using identical methodology for men and women.Methods: 2 groups (20 men, 20 women) viewed movie clips (erotic, humor) while genital temperature was continuously measured using infrared thermal imaging. Participants also continuously evaluated changes in their subjective arousal and answered discrete questions about liking the movies and wanting sexual stimulation. Brain activity, indicated by blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response, was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging.Outcomes: BOLD responses, genital temperature, and subjective sexual arousal.Results: BOLD activity in a number of brain regions was correlated with changes in genital temperature in men and women; however, activation in women appeared to be more extensive than in men, including the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, right cerebellum, insula, frontal operculum, and paracingulate gyrus. Examination of the strength of the correlation between BOLD response and genital temperature showed that women had a stronger brain-genital relation compared with men in a number of regions. There were no brain regions in men with stronger brain-genital correlations than in women.Clinical Translation: Our findings shed light on the neurophysiologic processes involved in genital arousal for men and women. Further research examining the specific brain regions that mediate our findings is necessary to pave the way for clinical application.Strengths and Limitations: A strength of the study is the use of thermography, which allows for a direct comparison of the neural correlates of genital arousal in men and women. This study has the common limitations of most laboratory-based sexual arousal research, including sampling bias, lack of ecologic validity, and equipment limitations, and those common to neuroimaging research, including BOLD signal interpretation and neuroimaging analysis issues.Conclusions: Our findings provide direct sex comparisons of the neural correlates of genital arousal in men and women and suggest that brain-genital correlations could be stronger in women.

Here we investigated the across-subjects similarity of brain responses to speech and non-speech sounds in a continuous audio drama designed for blind people. Thirteen healthy adults listened for similar to 19 min to the audio drama while their brain activity was measured with 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An intersubject-correlation (ISC) map, computed across the whole experiment to assess the stimulus-driven extrinsic brain network, indicated statistically significant ISC in temporal, frontal and parietal cortices, cingulate cortex, and amygdala. Group-level independent component (IC) analysis was used to parcel out the brain signals into functionally coupled networks, and the dependence of the ICs on external stimuli was tested by comparing them with the ISC map. This procedure revealed four extrinsic ICs of which two-covering non-overlapping areas of the auditory cortex-were modulated by both speech and non-speech sounds. The two other extrinsic ICs, one left-hemisphere-lateralized and the other right-hemisphere-lateralized, were speech-related and comprised the superior and middle temporal gyri, temporal poles, and the left angular and inferior orbital gyri. In areas of low ISC four ICs that were defined intrinsic fluctuated similarly as the time-courses of either the speech-sound-related or all-sounds-related extrinsic ICs. These ICs included the superior temporal gyrus, the anterior insula, and the frontal, parietal and midline occipital cortices. Taken together, substantial intersubject synchronization of cortical activity was observed in subjects listening to an audio drama, with results suggesting that speech is processed in two separate networks, one dedicated to the processing of speech sounds and the other to both speech and non-speech sounds.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 23734202.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Animal research suggests that such effects may result from actions of catecholamines and glucocorticoids that converge in brain regions that regulate motivated behaviors and incentive processing. At present, however, little is known about the acute effects of stress on these circuits in humans. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), twenty-seven healthy young women performed a modified version of the monetary incentive delay (MID) task, which is known to robustly engage ventral striatal and medial prefrontal regions. To induce psychological stress, strongly aversive movie clips (versus neutral movie clips) were shown with the instruction to imagine being an eyewitness. Physiological (cortisol levels, heart rate frequency, and heart rate variability) and subjective measurements confirmed successful induction of moderate levels of acute psychological stress. Brain imaging data revealed that stress induction resulted in a significant decrease in reward-related responses in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) without affecting ventral striatal responses. Our results thus show that acute psychological stress induces regionally specific changes in functioning of incentive processing circuits. This regional specificity is in line with animal data showing inverted U-shaped relations between levels of stress-related neuromodulators and functioning of the PFC, a structure that is believed to be critical for coordinating behavior in accordance with higher order internal goals. Our findings thus suggest that stress-related increases in habitual and reward-seeking behaviors may be triggered primarily by an impairment of such PFC-dependent cognitive control mechanisms.

Thus, understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms of humor is particularly important. Previous studies that investigated neural substrates of humor used functional MRI and to a lesser extent EEG. In the present study, we conducted intracranial recording in human patients, enabling us to obtain the signal with high temporal precision from within specific brain locations. Our analysis focused on the temporal lobe and the surrounding areas, the temporal lobe was most densely covered in our recording. Thirteen patients watched a fragment of a Charlie Chaplin movie. An independent group of healthy participants rated the same movie fragment, helping us to identify the most funny and the least funny frames of the movie. We compared neural activity occurring during the most funny and least funny frames across frequencies in the range of 1-170 Hz. The most funny compared to least funny parts of the movie were associated with activity modulation in the broadband high-gamma (70-170 Hz; mostly activation) and to a lesser extent gamma band (40-69Hz; activation) and low frequencies (1-12 Hz, delta, theta, alpha bands; mostly deactivation). With regard to regional specificity, we found three types of brain areas: (I) temporal pole, middle and inferior temporal gyrus (both anterior and posterior) in which there was both activation in the high-gamma/gamma bands and deactivation in low frequencies; (II) ventral part of the temporal lobe such as the fusiform gyrus, in which there was mostly deactivation the low frequencies; (III) posterior temporal cortex and its environment, such as the middle occipital and the temporo-parietal junction, in which there was activation in the high-gamma/gamma band. Overall, our results suggest that humor appreciation might be achieved by neural activity across the frequency spectrum.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 37061128.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particularly in cases when subjects' cooperation with instructions cannot be guaranteed (e.g., in neurological patients), a protocol is needed that could be independent from attention and behavioral tasks. In this study, we aimed at designing a novel approach for neuromagnetic recordings of brain activity which could allow for probing the neural foundations underpinning three key levels of speech comprehension: lexical, semantic, and (morpho)syntactic, without requiring active attention on speech input or any active task, while keeping the recording session duration as short as possible. To this end, we designed two different auditory paradigms using the same set of single word-based lexical, semantic, and syntactic contrasts: a modified version of the multifeature oddball paradigm and an equiprobable design. Combined magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography data were recorded form young, healthy participants, presented with these stimuli while watching a silent movie. Data from the equiprobable design yielded significant activations in temporal and inferior frontal areas associated with the lexical, semantic, and morphosyntactic contrasts. In turn, neural dissociations observed in the multifeature paradigm emerged mainly in temporal cortices, and were confined to the lexical and semantic conditions with a striking lack of any statistically significant effects for syntactic violations. Our findings indicate that, by employing the equiprobable design, a comprehensive range of key linguistic processes could be assessed in a passive, attention-free manner within a relatively short time (here, similar to 27 min), thus making this paradigm a time-efficient and patient-friendly tool.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 32057113.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explored this question by letting Five subjects freely view half an hour of a popular movie while undergoing functional brain imaging. Applying an unbiased analysis in which spatiotemporal activity patterns in one brain were used to model activity in another brain, we found a striking level of voxel-by-voxel synchronization between individuals, not only in primary and secondary visual and auditory areas but also in association cortices. The results reveal a surprising tendency of individual brains to tick collectively during natural vision. The intersubject synchronization consisted of a widespread cortical activation pattern correlated with emotionally arousing scenes and regionally selective components.

This protocol is based on a sparse sampling acquisition technique and allowed participants to complete a referential communication task with a real interaction partner. During verbal interactions, speakers adjust their verbal productions depending on their interlocutors' knowledge of the referents being mentioned. These adjustments have been linked to theory of mind (ToM), the ability to infer other's mental states. We thus sought to determine if the brain regions supporting ToM would also be activated during a referential communication task in which participants have to present movie characters that vary in their likelihood of being known by their interlocutor. This pilot study establishes that the sparse sampling strategy is a viable option to study the neural correlates of referential communication while minimizing movement artefacts. In addition, the brain regions supporting ToM were recruited during the task, though specifically for the conditions where participants could adjust their verbal productions to the interlocutor's likely knowledge of the referent. This study therefore demonstrates the feasibility and relevance of a sparse-sampling approach to study verbal interactions with fMRI, including referential communication.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 34638049.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, our understanding of the role of motion in emotion perception remains limited. On the one hand, movies continuously depict local motion-movements of objects and humans, which are crucial for generating emotional responses. Movie scenes also frequently portray global motion, mainly induced by large camera movements, global motion being yet another source of information used by the brain during natural vision. Here we used functional MRI to elucidate the contributions of local and global motion to emotion perception during movie viewing. Subjects observed long (1 min) movie segments depicting emotional or neutral content. Brain activity in areas that showed preferential responses to emotional content was strongly linked over time with frame-wide variations in global motion, and to a lesser extent with local motion information. Similarly, stronger responses to emotional content were recorded within regions of interest whose activity was attuned to global and local motion over time. Since global motion fields are experienced during self-motion, we suggest that camera movements may induce illusory self-motion cues in viewers that interact with the movie's narrative and with other emotional cues in generating affective responses.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 30022121.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we investigated how emotionally positive and negative information differentially influenced subsequent brain activity at rest. We acquired fMRI data in 15 participants during rest periods following fearful, joyful, and neutral movies. Several brain regions were more active during resting than during movie-watching, including posterior/anterior cingulate cortices (PCC. ACC), bilateral insula and inferior parietal lobules (IPL). Functional connectivity at different frequency bands was also assessed using a wavelet correlation approach and small-world network analysis. Resting activity in ACC and insula as well as their coupling were strongly enhanced by preceding emotions, while coupling between ventral-medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala was selectively reduced. These effects were more pronounced after fearful than joyful movies for higher frequency bands. Moreover, the initial suppression of resting activity in ACC and insula after emotional stimuli was followed by a gradual restoration over time. Emotions did not affect IPL average activity but increased its connectivity with other regions. These findings reveal specific neural circuits recruited during the recovery from emotional arousal and highlight the complex functional dynamics of default mode networks in emotionally salient contexts.

Inscapes, a non-social and non-verbal movie paradigm, has been introduced to increase attention, thus mitigating head motion, while reducing the task-induced activations found during typical movie watching. Inscapes has not yet been validated for use in magnetoencephalography (MEG), and it has yet to be shown whether its effects are stable in clinical populations. Across typically developing (N = 32) children and adolescents and those with ASD (N = 46) and ADHD (N = 42), we demonstrate that head motion is reduced during Inscapes. Due to the task state evoked by movie paradigms, we also expectedly observed concomitant modulations in local neural activity (oscillatory power) and functional connectivity (phase and envelope coupling) in intrinsic resting-state networks and across the frequency spectra compared to a fixation cross resting-state. Increases in local activity were accompanied by decreases in low-frequency connectivity within and between resting-state networks, primarily the visual network, suggesting that task-state evoked by Inscapes moderates ongoing and spontaneous cortical inhibition that forms the idling intrinsic networks found during a fixation cross resting-state. Importantly, these effects were similar in ASD and ADHD, making Inscapes a well-suited advancement for investigations of resting brain function in young and clinical populations.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33147510.0","","","","EEG/MEG; Eye/Head Movements; Functional Connectivity; Modified Movie Stimulus; New Type of Movie Stimuli","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To advance understanding of underlying neural mechanisms, we measured brain hemodynamic activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in individuals with ASD and matched-pair neurotypical (NT) controls while they were viewing a feature film portraying social interactions. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used as a measure of voxelwise similarity of brain activity (InterSubject Correlations-ISCs). Individuals with ASD showed lower ISC than NT controls in brain regions implicated in processing social information including the insula, posterior and anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, precuneus, lateral occipital cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Curiously, also within NT group, autism-quotient scores predicted ISC in overlapping areas, including, e.g., supramarginal gyrus and precuneus. In ASD participants, functional connectivity was decreased between the frontal pole and the superior frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, precuneus, and anterior/posterior cingulate gyrus. Taken together these results suggest that ISC and functional connectivity measure distinct features of atypical brain function in high-functioning autistic individuals during free viewing of acted social interactions. Our ISC results suggest that the minds of ASD individuals do not 'tick together' with others while perceiving identical dynamic social interactions. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

According to the differential emotions theory (DET), primary emotions are constituted of three distinct components: the neural-evaluative, the expressive, and the experiential. The DIET further assumes that these three components are biologically based and functional nearly from birth. Such a view entails that the neural substrate of primary emotions must be similar in children and adults. Guided by this assumption of the DET, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted to identify the neural correlates of sad feelings in healthy children. Fourteen healthy girls (aged 8-10) were scanned while they watched sad film excerpts aimed at externally inducing a transient state of sadness (activation task). Emotionally neutral film excerpts were also presented to the subjects (reference task). The subtraction of the brain activity measured during the viewing of the emotionally neutral film excerpts from that noted during the viewing of the sad film excerpts revealed that sad feelings were associated with significant bilateral activations of the midbrain, the medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area [BA] 10), and the anterior temporal pole (BA 21). A significant locus of activation was also noted in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 47). These results are compatible with those of previous functional neuroimaging studies of sadness in adults. They suggest that the neural substrate underlying the subjective experience of sadness is comparable in children and adults. Such a similitude provides empirical support to the DIET assumption that the neural substrate of primary emotions is biologically based. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain responses to familiar and novel stimuli. Young adults participated in a familiarization paradigm designed to mimic 'natural' exposure while older adults were presented with stimuli they had known for more than 50 years. Intersubject synchrony was calculated to detect common stimulus-driven brain activity across young and older adults as they listened to the novel and familiar stimuli. Contrary to our hypotheses, synchrony was not related to the amount of stimulus exposure; both young and older adults showed more synchrony to novel than to familiar stimuli regardless of whether the stimuli had been heard once, known for a few weeks, or known for more than 50 years. In young adults these synchrony differences were found across the brain in the bilateral temporal lobes, and in the frontal orbital cortex. In older adults the synchrony differences were found only in the bilateral temporal lobes. This reduction may be related to an increase in idiosyncratic responses after exposure to a stimulus but does not seem to be related to how well the stimuli are learned or to differences in attention. Until the effects of repeated exposure on synchrony are fully understood, future studies using intersubject synchrony, where the novelty of the stimuli cannot be guaranteed, may consider exposing all of their participants to the stimuli once before data are collected to mitigate the effects of any systematic differences in stimulus exposure.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Similar impairments are seen in various psychiatric disorders that are associated with higher susceptibility to stress and with prefrontal cortical dysfunctions, suggesting that acute stress may play a potential role in such dysfunctions. However, it remains unknown whether acute stress has immediate effects on WM-related prefrontal activity.Methods: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated neural activity of 27 healthy female participants during a blocked WM task (numerical N-back) while moderate psychological stress was induced by viewing strongly aversive (vs. neutral) movie material together with a self-referencing instruction. To assess stress manipulation, autonomic and endocrine, as well as subjective, measurements were acquired throughout the experiment.Results: Successfully induced acute stress resulted in significantly reduced WM-related activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and was accompanied by less deactivation in brain regions that are jointly referred to as the default mode network.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that experimentally induced acute stress in healthy volunteers results in a reduction of WM-related DLPFC activity and reallocation of neural resources away from executive function networks. These effects may be explained by supraoptimal levels of catecholamines potentially in conjunction with elevated levels of cortisol. A similar mechanism involving acute stress as a mediating factor may play an important role in higher-order cognitive deficits and hypofrontality observed in various psychiatric disorders.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 19403118.0","","","","Bodily Signals; Movie As Secondary; OUT-OF-SCOPE; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this study was to assess the impact of continuity editing on how people perceive the structure of events in a narrative film and to identify brain networks that are associated with the processing of different types of continuity editing boundaries. Participants viewed a commercially produced film and segmented it into meaningful events, while brain activity was recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We identified three degrees of continuity that can occur at editing locations: edits that are continuous in space, time, and action; edits that are discontinuous in space or time but continuous in action; and edits that are discontinuous in action as well as space or time. Discontinuities in action had the biggest impact on behavioral event segmentation, and discontinuities in space and time had minor effects. Edits were associated with large transient increases in early visual areas. Spatial-temporal changes and action changes produced strikingly different patterns of transient change, and they provided evidence that specialized mechanisms in higher order perceptual processing regions are engaged to maintain continuity of action in the face of spatiotemporal discontinuities. These results suggest that commercial film editing is shaped to support the comprehension of meaningful events that bridge breaks in low-level visual continuity, and even breaks in continuity of spatial and temporal location.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 21972849.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We wanted to learn whether functional segregation is maintained during more natural, complex, and dynamic conditions when many features have to be processed simultaneously, and identify regions whose activity correlates with the perception of specific features. To achieve this, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity when human observers viewed freely dynamic natural scenes (a James Bond movie). The intensity with which they perceived different features (color, faces, language, and human bodies) was assessed psychometrically in separate sessions. In all subjects different features were perceived with a high degree of independence over time. We found that the perception of each feature correlated with activity in separate, specialized areas whose activity also varied independently. We conclude that even in natural conditions, when many features have to be processed simultaneously, functional specialization is preserved. Our method thus opens a new way of brain mapping, which allows the localization of a multitude of brain areas based on a single experiment using uncontrolled, natural stimuli. Furthermore, our results show that the intensity of activity in a specialized area is linearly correlated with the intensity of its perceptual experience. This leads us to suggest that each specialized area is directly responsible for the creation of a feature-specific conscious percept (a microconsciousness).

Brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging.Main Outcome Measures: Blood oxygen level-dependent responses and continuous and discrete measurements of sexual arousal.Results: Erotic movies induced significant SSA in men and women. No sex difference in mean SSA was found in response to the erotic movies on continuous or discrete measurements. Several brain regions were correlated with changes in SSA. Parametric modulation with rating intensity showed a specific group of regions within the parietal lobe that showed significant differences in activity among low, medium, and high SSA.Conclusion: Multiple regions were concordant with changes in SSA; however, a subset of regions in men and women was modulated by SSA intensity, a subset previously linked to attentional processes, monitoring of internal body representation, and processing of sensory information from the genitals. This study highlights that similar brain regions are activated during subjective assessment of sexual arousal in men and women. The data further highlight the fact that SSA is a complex phenomenon made up of multiple interoceptive and attentional processes. Copyright (C) 2016, International Society for Sexual Medicine.

Here, we used fMRI to examine the effects of contextual signals derived from the content of the movie on the neural correlates underlying memory retrieval of temporal-order in human subjects of both sexes. By contrasting SAME versus DIFF storyline conditions during the retrieval of the temporal order of cinematic events, we found that the activation in the precuneus, as well as behavior, are significantly modulated according to storyline condition, supporting our prediction of contextual information contributing to temporal retrieval. We suggest that the precuneus engages in memory retrieval via reconstructive mechanisms, entailing search within a movie-specific, situational knowledge-structure. Furthermore, information-based analyses of multivoxel activity revealed that the precuneus also contains a context-independent linear representation of temporal distances, consistent with a chronological organization of memory traces. We thus put forward that the retrieval of the temporal-order of naturalistic events encoded in rich and dynamic contexts relies on the joint contribution of chronological and reconstructive mechanisms, both of which rely on the medioposterior parietal cortex in humans.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:07:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31996453.0","","","","Movie Recalling; OUT-OF-SCOPE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brain imaging studies to date commonly sacrifice valuable information regarding the individual real-time conscious experience, especially when focusing on elucidating the amygdala's activity. Here, we assumed that by using a minimally intrusive cue along with applying a robust clustering approach to probe the amygdala, it would be possible to rate fear in real time and to derive the related network of activation. During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, healthy volunteers viewed two excerpts from horror movies and were periodically auditory cued to rate their instantaneous experience of I'm scared. Using graph theory and community mathematical concepts, data-driven clustering of the fear-related functional cliques in the amygdala was performed guided by the individually marked periods of heightened fear. Individually tailored functions derived from these amygdala activation cliques were subsequently applied as general linear model predictors to a whole-brain analysis to reveal the correlated networks. Our results suggest that by using a localized robust clustering approach, it is possible to probe activation in the right dorsal amygdala that is directly related to individual real-time emotional experience. Moreover, this fear-evoked amygdala revealed two opposing networks of co-activation and co-deactivation, which correspond to vigilance and rest-related circuits, respectively.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 22432905.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, 24 healthy participants passively watched sad scene climaxes taken from 24 romantic comedies, while brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). To study effects of context, the sad scene climaxes were presented with either coherent scene context, replaced non-coherent context or without context. In a second viewing, the same clips were rated continuously for sadness. The ratings varied over time with peaks of experienced sadness within the assumed climax intervals. Activations in anterior and posterior cortical midline regions increased if presented with both coherent and replaced context, while activation in the temporal gyri decreased. This difference was more pronounced for the coherent context condition. Psycho Physiological interactions (PPI) analyses showed a context-dependent coupling of midline regions with occipital visual and sub-cortical reward regions. Our results demonstrate the pivotal role of midline structures and their interaction with perceptual and reward areas in processing contextually embedded socio-emotional information in movies.

Here we characterized individual differences in the location of neural event boundaries across four short movies that evoked variable interpretations. Event boundary alignment across subjects followed a posterior-to-anterior gradient that was tightly correlated with the rate of segmentation: slower-segmenting regions that integrate information over longer time periods showed more individual variability in boundary locations. This relationship held irrespective of the stimulus, but the degree to which boundaries in particular regions were shared versus idiosyncratic depended on certain aspects of movie content. Furthermore, this variability was behaviorally significant in that similarity of neural boundary locations during movie-watching predicted similarity in how the movie was ultimately remembered and appraised. In particular, we identified a subset of regions in which neural boundary locations are both aligned with behavioral boundaries during encoding and predictive of stimulus interpretation, suggesting that event segmentation may be a mechanism by which narratives generate variable memories and appraisals of stimuli.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 36994470.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We reasoned that the brain activity recorded in a visual area that is invariant to eye movement should be similar under fixation and free viewing conditions. In contrast, activity in a visual area that is sensitive to eye movement should differ between fixation and free viewing. We therefore measured the similarity of brain activity across repeated presentations of the same movie within the fixation condition, and separately between the fixation and free viewing conditions. The ratio of these measures was used to determine which brain areas are most likely to contain eye movement-invariant representations. We found that voxels located in early visual areas are strongly affected by eye movements, while voxels in ventral temporal areas are only weakly affected by eye movements. These results suggest that the ventral temporal visual areas contain a stable representation of the visual world that is invariant to eye movements made during natural vision.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 28114479.0","","","","Eye/Head Movements; fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Naturalistic stimuli, such as movies, closely mimic the real world and provide a window onto the brain's ability to respond in a timely and measured fashion to complex, everyday events. Young adults respond to these stimuli in a highly synchronized fashion, but it remains to be seen how age affects neural responsiveness during naturalistic viewing. To this end, we scanned a large (N = 218), population-based sample from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) during movie-watching. Intersubject synchronization declined with age, such that older adults' response to the movie was more idiosyncratic. This decreased synchrony related to cognitive measures sensitive to attentional control. Our findings suggest that neural responsivity changes with age, which likely has important implications for real-world event comprehension and memory. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Conventional functional MRI (fMRI) memory paradigms have yet to fully convince of their ability to confidently assess the risk of a post-surgical amnesia. An alternative fMRI analysis method, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), focuses on the patterns of activity across voxels in specific brain regions that are associated with individual memory traces. This method makes it possible to investigate whether the hippocampus and related structures contralateral to any proposed surgery are capable of laying down and representing specific memories. Here we used MVPA-fMRI to assess the functional integrity of the hippocampi and MTL in patients with long-standing medically refractory TLE associated with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Patients were exposed to movie clips of everyday events prior to scanning, which they subsequently recalled during high-resolution fMRI. MTL structures were delineated and pattern classifiers were trained to learn the patterns of brain activity across voxels associated with each memory. Predictable patterns of activity across voxels associated with specific memories could be detected in MTL structures, including the hippocampus, on the side contralateral to the HS, indicating their functional viability. By contrast, no discernible memory representations were apparent in the sclerotic hippocampus, but adjacent MTL regions contained detectable information about the memories. These findings suggest that MVPA in fMRI memory studies of TLE can indicate hippocampal functional reserve and may be useful to predict the effects of hippocampal resection in individual patients.

Multivoxel pattern analysis allows us to investigate information encoding through these patterns; however, we have yet to explore local, stimulus-driven, patterns of cortical activity during naturalistic stimulation. We sought to examine these patterns with minimum interpolation-excluding functional alignment-to characterize the most basic degree of shared response between subjects. We used an unbiased analytic approach, combined with rich, naturalistic, and nonsemantic stimulation to estimate shared spatial patterns in functional magnetic resonance imaging responses across a large group. We found that meso-scale spatial patterns were shared nonuniformly across the visual cortex and represent information distinct from the shared temporal response. Shared spatial patterns were stimulus-driven, modulated by pattern size, and more sensitive to the contrast of 3D versus 2D stimulus differences than the temporal signals. Although the grand functional structure of the brain is understood to be common, these results suggest that even at a meso-scale, we share common spatial structures with anatomical alignment alone. The strength of this similarity varies across the cortex, suggesting some spatial structures are innately organized, whereas others are shaped by factors such as learning and plasticity.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33251511.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-eight participants viewed pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and, in a separate session, watched various movie-trailers. We first located voxels at bilateral occipital cortex (LOC) responsive to affective picture categories by GLM analysis, then performed between-subject hyperalignment on the LOC voxels based on their responses during movie-trailer watching. After hyperalignment, we trained between-subject machine learning classifiers on the affective pictures, and used the classifiers to decode affective states of an out-of-sample participant both during picture viewing and during movie-trailer watching. Within participants, neural classifiers identified valence and arousal categories of pictures, and tracked self-reported valence and arousal during video watching. In aggregate, neural classifiers produced valence and arousal time series that tracked the dynamic ratings of the movie-trailers obtained from a separate sample.

The voluntary control that people can exert on brain mechanisms that map the emotions of others onto our own emotions has received comparatively less attention. Here, we therefore measured brain activity while participants watched emotional Hollywood movies under two different instructions: to rate the main characters’ emotions by empathizing with them, or to do so while keeping a detached perspective. We found that participants yielded highly consistent and similar ratings of emotions under both conditions. Using intersubject correlation-based analyses we found that, when encouraged to empathize, participants’ brain activity in limbic (including cingulate and putamen) and somatomotor regions (including premotor, SI and SII) synchronized more during the movie than when encouraged to detach. Using intersubject functional connectivity we found that comparing the empathic and detached perspectives revealed widespread increases in functional connectivity between large scale networks. Our findings contribute to the increasing awareness that we have voluntary control over the neural mechanisms through which we process the emotions of others.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31931155.0","","","","Emotional Topology; fMRI; Functional Connectivity; Subjective Rating","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 15 subjects watching movies of three genres, an animation (S1), Indian Hindi (S2), and a Hollywood English (S3) movie. The hypothesis of the study is that empathic engagement in a movie narrative would modulate the activation with the DMN. The clippings were individually rated for emotional expressions, context, and empathy self-response by the fMRI subjects post scanning and by 40 participants in an independent survey who rated at four time intervals in each clipping. The analysis illustrates the following: (a) the ICA method separated ICs with areas reported for empathy response and anterior/posterior DMNs. An IC indicating insula region activation reported to be crucial for the emotional empathy network was separated for S2 and S3 movies only, but not for S1, (b) the dFNC between DMN and ICs corresponding to cognitive empathy network showed higher positive periodical fluctuating correlations for all three movies, while ICs with areas crucial to motor or emotional empathy display lower positive or negative correlation values with no distinct periodicity. A possible explanation for the lower values and anticorrelation between the DMN and emotional empathy networks could possibly be inhibition due to internal self-reflections, attributed to DMN, while processing and preparing a response to external emotional content. The positive higher correlation values for cognitive empathy networks may reflect a functional overlap with DMN for enhanced internal self-reflections, inferring beliefs and intentions about the 'other', all triggered by the external stimuli. The findings are useful in the study of deviations in functional synergies of large complex networks associated with empathy responses and DMN in clinical applications like autism and schizophrenia.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:10:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 25891898.0","","","","fMRI; Functional Connectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preoperative brain mapping is necessary to weigh the risk of resection with the risk of postoperative deficit. However, the use of conventional mapping methods (e.g., somatosensory stimulation, task-based functional MRI [fMRI]) in pediatric patients is technically difficult due to low compliance and their unique neurophysiology. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), a task-free technique based on the neural activity of the brain at rest, has the potential to overcome these limitations. The authors hypothesized that language networks can be identified from rs-fMRI by applying functional connectivity analyses.METHODS Cases in which both task-based fMRI and rs-fMRI were acquired as part of the preoperative clinical protocol for epilepsy surgery were reviewed. Task-based fMRI consisted of 2 language tasks and 1 motor task. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired while the patients watched an animated movie and were analyzed using independent component analysis (i.e., data-driven method). The authors extracted language networks from rs-fMRI data by performing a similarity analysis with functionally defined language network templates via a template-matching procedure. The Dice coefficient was used to quantify the overlap.RESULTS Thirteen children underwent conventional task-based fMRI (e.g., verb generation, object naming), rs-fMRI, and structural imaging at 1.5T. The language components with the highest overlap with the language templates were identified for each patient. Language lateralization results from task-based fMRI and rs-fMRI mapping were comparable, with good concordance in most cases. Resting-state fMRI-derived language maps indicated that language was on the left in 4 patients (31%), on the right in 5 patients (38%), and bilateral in 4 patients (31%). In some cases, rs-fMRI indicated a more extensive language representation.CONCLUSIONS Resting-state fMRI-derived language network data were identified at the patient level using a template-matching method. More than half of the patients in this study presented with atypical language lateralization, emphasizing the need for mapping. Overall, these data suggest that this technique may be used to preoperatively identify language networks in pediatric patients. It may also optimize presurgical planning of electrode placement and thereby guide the surgeon's approach to the epileptogenic zone.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33418528.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The established strategy to increase MEG's SNR involves averaging multiple repetitions of data corresponding to the same stimulus. However, repetition of stimulus can be undesirable, because underlying neural activity has been shown to change across trials, and repeating stimuli limits the breadth of the stimulus space experienced by subjects. In particular, the rising popularity of naturalistic studies with a single viewing of a movie or story necessitates the discovery of new approaches to increase SNR. We introduce a simple framework to reduce noise in single-trial MEG data by leveraging correlations in neural responses across subjects as they experience the same stimulus. We demonstrate its use in a naturalistic reading comprehension task with 8 subjects, with MEG data collected while they read the same story a single time. We find that our procedure results in data with reduced noise and allows for better discovery of neural phenomena. As proof-of-concept, we show that the N400m's correlation with word surprisal, an established finding in literature, is far more clearly observed in the denoised data than the original data. The denoised data also shows higher decoding and encoding accuracy than the original data, indicating that the neural signals associated with reading are either preserved or enhanced after the denoising procedure.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 34858157.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, a variety of features extracted from sensor EEG signals are used for emotion recognition. However, they cannot unambiguously describe the location of emotions associated with neural activities and information propagation or the interaction between brain regions. In addition, most current studies use low-density sensor EEG signals. Moreover, source signals estimated from high-density sensor EEG signal have not been employed for emotion recognition to date. We designed a BDC network-based framework using EEG source signals to investigate emotion recognition. The global cortex factor-based multivariate autoregressive (GCF-MVAR) method was utilized to extract emotion-related BDC features. Our study revealed that the combined BDC and DE features facilitated a recognition accuracy of up to 89.58 percent, which is higher than the rate obtained from BDC features and DE features alone. The sensor features derived from high-density EEG signals also exhibited higher recognition accuracy compared to low-density EEG signals. These findings suggest that BDC features derived from EEG source signals can better characterize human emotional states and are meaningful for emotion recognition.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: nan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate this, we made simultaneous recordings of surface EEG, intracortical local field potential, and multiunit activity (MUA) in the alert monkey visual cortex during presentation of natural movies. Using a general linear model, we show that in single trials, EEG power in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) and phase in delta band (2-4 Hz) are significant predictors of the MUA response. Specifically, we found that the MUA response was strongest only when increases in EEG gamma power occurred during the negative-going phase of the delta wave, thus revealing a frequency-and coupling mechanism that can be exploited to infer population spiking activity. This finding may open up a new dimension in the use and interpretation of EEG in normal and pathological conditions.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 19874794.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, subjects watched short movie clips, and after a short retention (1.5-2.5 s), made mnemonic judgments about specific aspects of the clips. In Experiment 1, subjects were presented with two scenes and required to either choose the scene that happened earlier in the clip (scene-chronology), or with a correct spatial arrangement (scene-layout), or that had been shown (scene-recognition). To segregate activity specific to seen versus unseen stimuli, in Experiment 2 only one probe image was presented (either target or foil). Across the two experiments, we replicated three patterns underlying the three specific forms of memory judgment. The precuneus was activated during temporal-order retrieval, the superior parietal cortex was activated bilaterally for spatial-related configuration judgments, whereas the medial frontal cortex during scene recognition. Conjunction analyses with a previous study that used analogous retrieval tasks, but a much longer delay (>1 day), demonstrated that this dissociation pattern is independent of retention delay. We conclude that analogous brain regions mediate task-specific retrieval across vastly different delays, consistent with the proposal of scale-invariance in episodic memory retrieval.

In rodents, such effects are mediated by stress-induced alterations in catecholaminergic signaling, but human data in support of this notion is lacking. A common variation in the gene encoding Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is known to affect basal catecholaminergic availability and PFC functions. Here, we investigated whether this genetic variation (Val158Met) modulates effects of stress on WM-related neural activity in humans. In a counterbalanced crossover design, 41 healthy young men underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a numerical N-back WM task embedded in a stressful or neutral context. Moderate psychological stress was induced by a well-controlled procedure involving viewing strongly aversive (versus emotionally neutral) movie material in combination with a self-referencing instruction. Acute stress resulted in genotype-dependent effects on WM performance and WM-related activation in the dorsolateral PFC, with a relatively negative impact of stress in COMT Met-homozygotes as opposed to a relatively positive effect in Val-carriers. A parallel interaction was found for WM-related deactivation in the anterior medial temporal lobe (MTL). Our findings suggest that individuals with higher baseline catecholaminergic availability (COMT Met-homozygotes) appear to reach a supraoptimal state under moderate levels of stress. In contrast, individuals with lower baselines (Val-carriers) may reach an optimal state. Thus, our data show that effects of acute stress on higher-order cognitive functions vary depending on catecholaminergic availability at baseline, and thereby corroborate animal models of catecholaminergic signaling that propose a non-linear relationship between catecholaminergic activity and prefrontal functions.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 22593737.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this question, we carried out an fMRI study using an emotional activation paradigm. Brain activity associated with passive viewing of an emotionally laden film clip aimed at inducing a transient state of sadness was contrasted with that associated with passive viewing of an emotionally neutral film clip in patients suffering from unipolar depression and in normal control subjects. Results showed that transient sadness produced significant activation in the medial and inferior prefrontal cortices, the middle temporal cortex, the cerebellum and the caudate in both depressed and normal subjects. They also revealed that passive viewing of the emotionally laden film clip produced a significantly greater activation in the left medial prefrontal cortex and in the right cingulate gyrus in depressed patients than in normal control subjects. These findings suggest that these two cortical regions might be part of a neural network implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression.

Three different analysis methods were used to map the social perceptual processes in the human brain. Regression analysis mapped regional neural response profiles for different social dimensions. Multivariate pattern analysis then established the spatial specificity of the responses and intersubject correlation analysis connected social perceptual processing with neural synchronization. The results revealed a gradient in the processing of social information in the brain. Posterior temporal and occipital regions were broadly tuned to most social dimensions and the classifier revealed that these responses showed spatial specificity for social dimensions; in contrast Heschl gyri and parietal areas were also broadly associated with different social signals, yet the spatial patterns of responses did not differentiate social dimensions.

However, little is known about whether or how these neural processes change over the course of healthy aging. Here, 546 cognitively normal participants 18-88 years old viewed a short movie while brain activity was measured using fMRI. The hippocampus and regions of the Posterior Medial network show increased activity at event boundaries, but these boundary-evoked responses decrease with age. Boundary-evoked activity in the posterior hippocampus predicts performance on a separate test of memory for stories, suggesting that hippocampal activity during event segmentation may be a broad indicator of individual differences in episodic memory ability. In contrast, boundary-evoked responses in the medial prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus increase across the age range. These findings suggest that aging may alter neural processes for segmenting and remembering continuous real-world experiences. Although our lives are continuous, we perceive and remember experiences as discrete events.

We found that IPS and TPJ consistently responded to insert shots, and the correlation between TPJ and IPS responses significantly predicted the prevalence of belief inferences during the sequence. In addition, TPJ responded significantly to entrances and exits of characters. We also competed a qualitative analysis of moments during a sequence that induced relative peaks in TPJ and IPS responding. These analyses not only demonstrate that consistent brain responses can distinguish among meaningful variations in cinematic events but also that these analyses confirm and refine our understanding of the apparent specializations for visual attention and domain-specific event processing in parietal attention networks.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: nan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known regarding how this flexibility is achieved in the human brain. We examined brain activity during retrieval of false memories of a movie, generated by exposing participants to misleading information. Half of the participants suspected the memory manipulation (Distrustful), whereas the other half did not (Naive). Distrustful displayed more accurate memory performance and a brain signature different than that of Naive. In Distrustful, the ability to differentiate true from false information was driven by a qualitatively distinct hippocampal activity for endorsed items, consistent with the view that hippocampal encoding allows recollection of a specific source. Conversely, in Naive, BOLD differences between true and false memories were linearly correlated with accuracy across participants, suggesting that Naive subjects needed to reinstate and evaluate stored information to discern true from false. We propose that our results lend support to models suggesting that hippocampal activity can exhibit different computational schemes, depending on memorandum attributes. Furthermore, we show that trust, considered as a subjective state of mind, may alter basic hippocampal strategies, influencing the ability to separate real from false memory.

Theta power during learning and retrieval has been found to correlate with memory performance success. Additionally, up-regulating theta oscillations during a post-encoding epoch crucial for memory consolidation was previously shown to benefit long-term memory for acquired motor sequences, pictures, and object-location associations. However, it remains to be determined whether such effects would be found for more ecological aspects of long-term episodic memory. Therefore, the current study assessed neurofeedback-based theta upregulation effects on movie memory. After viewing a 15-minute silent, narrative movie, participants engaged in neurofeedback-based theta/beta up-regulation, neurofeedback beta/theta up-regulation as an active control condition, or an unrelated passive control task. Memory was tested three times: once immediately after watching the movie (as baseline); 24 hours thereafter; and once again 1 week later. Memory performance 1 week after encoding was significantly enhanced in the theta/beta up-regulation group compared with the other groups. Additionally, changes in neurofeedback theta/beta ratio from baseline EEG recordings correlated with long-term memory gains in retrieving the movie's content. These findings highlight the relationship between post-learning theta oscillations and the consolidation of episodic memory for a naturalistic event.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 37752389.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the cost of collecting the information from people is problematic. This article proposes a scheme that resolves the tradeoff between the inference performance from a profile model to a brain model and the cost of collecting profile information. In the proposed scheme, a machine learning model infers the brain model from the profile model and a feature selection method is applied to reduce the cost, i.e., the number of questionnaire items, of collecting profile information. Since only the top questionnaire items with the highest importance scores are used, we can maintain the inference performance as high as possible while limiting the number of questionnaire items. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with a performance evaluation using an experimentally obtained brain model and a profile model created from real profile information. The results over different experimental parameters, video lengths, and feature selection methods demonstrate that the proposed scheme successfully identifies the top questionnaire items that contribute most significantly to the inference of brain models.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: nan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous researchers correlated natural stimuli with brain responses to explore brain functional specialization by reverse correlation methods, which were based on within-group analysis. However, what external stimuli drove significantly different brain responses in two groups of different subjects were still unknown. To address this, sliding time windows technique combined with inter-Subject functional correlation (ISFC) was proposed to detect movie events with significant group differences between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development (TD) subjects. Then, using inter-Subject correlation (ISC) and ISFC analysis, we found that in three movie events involving character emotions, the ASD group showed significantly lower ISC in the middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole, cerebellum, caudate, precuneus, and showed decreased functional connectivity between large scale networks than that in TD. Under the movie event focusing on objects and scenes shot, the dorsal and ventral attentional networks of ASD had a strong synchronous response. Meanwhile, ASD also displayed increased functional connectivity between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and dorsal attention network (DAN), FPN, and sensorimotor network (SMN) than TD. ASD has its own unique synchronous response rather than being unresponsive in natural movie-watching. Our findings provide a new method and valuable insight for exploring the inconsistency of the brain tick collectively to same natural stimuli. This analytic approach has the potential to explore pathological mechanisms and promote training methods of ASD.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35591883.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electroencephalogram (EEG), based on emotion classification, has been widely utilized in the fields of interdisciplinary studies because of emotion representation's objectiveness. In this paper, it aimed to introduce the Korean continuous emotional database and investigate brain activity during emotional processing. Moreover, we selected emotion-related channels for verifying the generated database using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). First, we recorded EEG signals, collected from 28 subjects, to investigate the brain activity across brain areas while watching movie clips by five emotions (anger, excitement, fear, sadness, and happiness) and a neutral state. We analyzed EEG raw signals to investigate the emotion-related brain area and select suitable emotion-related channels using spectral power across frequency bands, i.e., alpha and beta bands. As a result, we select the eight-channel set, namely, AF3-AF4, F3-F4, F7-F8, and P7-P8, from statistical and brain topography analysis. We perform the classification using SVM and achieve the best accuracy of 94.27% when utilizing the selected channels set with five emotions. In conclusion, we provide a fundamental emotional database reflecting Korean feelings and the evidence of different emotions for application to broaden area.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: nan","","","","EEG/MEG; Short Clips; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we propose a hybrid approach that decomposes neural activity into multiple components, each representing a portion of the stimulus. The technique is implemented via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) by temporally filtering the stimulus (encoding) and spatially filtering the neural responses (decoding) such that the resulting components are maximally correlated. In contrast to existing methods, this approach recovers multiple correlated stimulus-response pairs, and thus affords a richer, multidimensional analysis of neural representations. We first validated the technique's ability to recover multiple stimulus-driven components using electroencephalographic (EEG) data simulated with a finite element model of the head. We then applied the technique to real EEG responses to auditory and audiovisual narratives experienced identically across subjects, as well as uniquely experienced video game play. During narratives, both auditory and visual stimulus-response correlations (SRC) were modulated by attention and tracked inter-subject correlations. During video game play, SRC varied with game difficulty and the presence of a dual task. Interestingly, the strongest component extracted for visual and auditory features of film clips had nearly identical spatial distributions, suggesting that the predominant encephalographic response to naturalistic stimuli is supramodal. The diversity of these findings demonstrates the utility of measuring multidimensional SRC via hybrid encoding-decoding.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:07:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 28545933.0","","","","EEG/MEG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in brain imaging (e.g., fMRI), the direct application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to decoding subject states or perception from imaging data seems impractical given the scarcity of available data.New method: In this work we propose a robust method to transfer information from deep learning (DL) features to brain fMRI data with the goal of decoding. By adopting Reduced Rank Regression with Ridge Regularisation we establish a multivariate link between imaging data and the fully connected layer (fc7) of a CNN. We exploit the reconstructed fc7 features by performing an object image classification task on two datasets: one of the largest fMRI databases, taken from different scanners from more than two hundred subjects watching different movie clips, and another with fMRI data taken while watching static images.Results: The fc7 features could be significantly reconstructed from the imaging data, and led to significant decoding performance.Comparison with existing methods: The decoding based on reconstructed fc7 outperformed the decoding based on imaging data alone.Conclusion: In this work we show how to improve fMRI-based decoding benefiting from the mapping between functional data and CNN features. The potential advantage of the proposed method is twofold: the extraction of stimuli representations by means of an automatic procedure (unsupervised) and the embedding of high-dimensional neuroimaging data onto a space designed for visual object discrimination, leading to a more manageable space from dimensionality point of view.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31585315.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While group-level functional alterations have been identified in many brain regions of psychotic patients, multivariate machine-learning methods provide a tool to test whether some of such alterations could be used to differentiate an individual patient. Earlier machine-learning studies have focused on data collected from chronic patients during rest or simple tasks. We set out to unravel brain activation patterns during naturalistic stimulation in first-episode psychosis (FEP).Method. We recorded brain activity from 46 FEP patients and 32 control subjects viewing scenes from the fantasy film Alice in Wonderland. Scenes with varying degrees of fantasy were selected based on the distortion of the ` sense of reality' in psychosis. After cleaning the data with a novel maxCorr method, we used machine learning to classify patients and healthy control subjects on the basis of voxel-and time-point patterns.Results. Most (136/194) of the voxels that best classified the groups were clustered in a bilateral region of the precuneus. Classification accuracies were up to 79.5% (p = 5.69 x 10(-8)), and correct classification was more likely the higher the patient's positive-symptom score. Precuneus functioning was related to the fantasy content of the movie, and the relationship was stronger in control subjects than patients.Conclusions. These findings are the first to show abnormalities in precuneus functioning during naturalistic information processing in FEP patients. Correlational findings suggest that these alterations are associated with positive psychotic symptoms and processing of fantasy. The results may provide new insights into the neuronal basis of reality distortion in psychosis.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 27776563.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although it is the most commonly used anesthetic in the world, much remains unknown about the mechanisms by which it induces a loss of consciousness. Characterizing anesthesia-induced alterations to brain network activity might provide a powerful framework for understanding the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness.The aim of this work was to model brain activity in healthy brains during various stages of consciousness, as induced by propofol, in the auditory paradigm. We used the generalized Ising model (GIM) to fit the empirical fMRI data of healthy subjects while they listened to an audio clip from a movie. The external stimulus (audio clip) is believed to be at least partially driving a synchronization process of the brain activity and provides a similar conscious experience in different subjects. In order to observe the common synchronization among the subjects, a novel technique called the inter subject correlation (ISC) was implemented.We showed that the GIM-modified to incorporate the naturalistic external field-was able to fit the empirical task fMRI data in the awake state, in mild sedation, in deep sedation, and in recovery, at a temperature T* which is well above the critical temperature. To our knowledge this is the first study that captures human brain activity in response to real-life external stimuli at different levels of conscious awareness using mathematical modeling. This study might be helpful in the future to assess the level of consciousness of patients with disorders of consciousness and help in regaining their consciousness.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 32931944.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the stimulus is a single speaker, it is usually assumed that the listener actively attends to and understands the stimulus. However, as the level of attention of the listener is inherently variable, we investigated how this affected neural envelope tracking. Using a movie as a distractor, we varied the level of attention while we estimated neural envelope tracking. We varied the intelligibility level by adding stationary noise. We found a significant difference in neural envelope tracking between the condition with maximal attention and the movie condition. This difference was most pronounced in the right-frontal region of the brain. The degree of neural envelope tracking was highly correlated with the stimulus signal-to-noise ratio, even in the movie condition. This could be due to residual neural resources to passively attend to the stimulus. When envelope tracking is used to measure speech understanding objectively, this means that the procedure can be made more enjoyable and feasible by letting participants watch a movie during stimulus presentation.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:06:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31607841.0","","","","Movie As Secondary; OUT-OF-SCOPE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, empathy, like other complex cognitive processes, is inherently linked to the activation of functional networks rather than of separate brain areas. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to explore the relationship between empathy and functional coupling of neuronal activity in primary somatosensory ( SI) and motor (MI) cortices. MEG recording was performed while healthy participants observed movie-clips depicting the static hand of a stranger model, the same hand deeply penetrated by a needle, or gently touched by a Q-tip. Subjects were asked to rate the movie-derived sensations attributed to self or to the model. For each type of clip observation, we analyzed spectral power and coherence values in alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. While spectral power indexes separate neural activity in SI and MI, coherence values index functional cross-talk between these two areas. No power changes of SI or MI sources were induced by observation conditions in any of the frequency bands. Crucially, gamma-band coherence values were significantly higher during needle-in-hand than touch and static hand observation and correlated with self-and other-referred pain ratings derived from needle-in-hand movies observation. Thus, observation of others' pain increases neuronal synchronization and cross-talk between the onlookers' sensory and motor cortices, indicating that empathic resonance relies upon the activity of functional networks more than of single areas.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 19812314.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 62-channel EEG was recorded in age-matched control individuals (n = 25) and Sahaja Yoga meditators (SYM, n = 25). Findings from the non-emotional continuum show that at the lowest level of arousal (eyes closed) SYM manifested larger power values in theta-1 (4-6 Hz), theta-2 (6-8 Hz) and alpha-1 (8-10 Hz) frequency bands. Although increasing arousal desynchronized activity in these bands in both groups, the theta-2 and alpha-l power in the eyes-open period and alpha-1 power while viewing the neutral clip remained still higher in the SYM. During eyes-closed and eyes-open periods the controls were marked by larger right than left hemisphere power, indexing relatively more active left hemisphere parieto-temporal cortex whereas meditators manifested no hemisphere asymmetry. When contrasted with the neutral, the aversive movie clip yielded significant alpha desynchronization both groups, reflecting arousing nature of emotional induction. In the control group along with alpha desynchronization affective movie clip synchronized gamma power over anterior cortical sites. This was not seen in the SYM. Overall, the presented report emphasizes that the revealed changes in the electrical brain activity associated with regular meditation practice are dynamical by nature and depend on arousal level. The EEG power findings also provide the first empirical proof of a theoretical assumption that meditators have better capabilities to moderate intensity of emotional arousal.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 16019582.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has investigated this phenomenon by showing that the typicality of one's sensory experience is associated with the typicality of their stimulus-evoked brain activity (as measured by intersubject correlation, or ISC). Individual differences in ISC have recently been attributed to variability in focal neural processing. However, the extent to which these differences reflect purely intra-regional variability versus variation in the brain's baseline ability to transmit information between regions has yet to be established. Here, we show that an individual's degree and spatial distribution of ISC are closely related to their brain's functional organization at rest. Using resting state and movie watching fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we reveal that resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) profiles can be used to predict cortex-wide ISC. Similar region-level analyses demonstrate that the levels of ISC exhibited by brain regions during movie watching are associated with their connectivity to other regions at rest, and that the nature of these connectivity-activity relationships varies as a function of regional roles in sensory information processing. Finally, we show that an individual's unique spatial distribution of ISC, independent of its magnitude, is also related to their RSFC profile. These findings contextualize reports of localized individual differences in ISC as potentially reflecting larger, network level alterations in resting brain function and detail how the brain's ability to process complex sensory information is linked to its baseline functional organization.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:09:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35304263.0","","","","fMRI; Functional Connectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we report results from fMRI data analyzed by group independent component analysis (ICA) method from a free viewing experiment using a diverse set of movie clips - an animation, a Hollywood and an Indian Hindi movie. The fMRI data were collected from 15 college students as they viewed 5-8 min clips from three movies. The movie clips were rated for depiction of emotional expressions, the emotion as per the narrative and the viewer's own empathy response. The neural correlates attributed to cognitive, motor and emotional empathy were the focus of the study. The methodology of using long duration stimuli in free viewing mode combined with ICA analysis has the potential to tease out spatially distributed but temporally coherent brain activity as demonstrated in this study. The independent components obtained from group ICA method isolated spatial maps with activations which can be safely ascribed to stimulus processing. We found that the activity in the areas attributable to cognitive and motor empathy was comparable for all the three stimuli while certain critical areas for emotional empathy were not noticed for the animation movie. These findings lead to interesting questions on possible differential emotion response in viewer(s) for computer generated actors compared to actors in live-action movies and the role of narrative and exposure to different genre of movies on racial, ethnic and cultural differences in empathy response.

Event segmentation dynamically engages a network of brain regions that likely play a role in how events are encoded. Here, in a sample of older adults, we assessed the relationship between changes in brain dynamics during movie watching and event understanding performance. Forty healthy older adults and a comparison sample of 12 younger adults passively viewed short movies of everyday activities while their brain activity was measured with fMRI. Afterward, they segmented the movies into events and performed memory tasks for movie content. The older adults engaged a similar event segmentation network during movie watching as the younger adults. Individual differences analyses revealed that although behavioral measures of event segmentation predicted memory, activity in the segmentation network did not. Intersubject correlation analyses revealed that normative brain dynamics during viewing in the right posterior temporal sulcus and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex predicted better segmentation performance. These data suggest that these regions play an important role in event understanding, and also that the event segmentation network is preserved in healthy aging.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29446971.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many viewers have reported various problems which are usually faced after watching 3D movies. These problems include visual fatigue, eye strain, headaches, dizziness, blurred vision or collectively may be termed as visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). This research focuses on the comparison between 3D passive technology with a conventional 2D technology to find that whether 3D is causing trouble in the viewers or not. For this purpose, an experiment was designed in which participants were randomly assigned to watch 2D or a 3D movie. The movie was specially designed to induce VIMS. The movie was shown for the duration of 10 min to every participant. The electroencephalogram (EEG) data was recorded throughout the session. At the end of the session, participants rated their feelings using simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ). The SSQ data was analyzed and the ratings of 2D and 3D participants were compared statistically by using a two tailed t test. From the SSQ results, it was found that participants watching 3D movies reported significantly higher symptoms of VIMS (p value < 0.05). EEG data was analyzed by using MATLAB and topographic plots are created from the data. A significant difference has been observed in the frontal-theta power which increases with the passage of time in 2D condition while decreases with time in 3D condition. Also, a decrease in beta power has been found in the temporal lobe of 3D group. Therefore, it is concluded that there are negative effects of 3D movies causing significant changes in the brain activity in terms of band powers. This condition leads to produce symptoms of VIMS in the viewers.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 26462677.0","","","","EEG/MEG; Modified Movie Stimulus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since it reflects brain activity directly, electroencephalography (EEG) has significant advantages in emotion classification research. This study recorded EEG signals from 12 participants while they perceived emotional audio-visual stimulation movie clips for four minutes. The six emotions studied were anger, excitement, fear, happiness, sadness, and a neutral state. We also perform raw data preprocessing to obtain clean data, extracting the power spectrum using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to generate feature vectors. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the classification of human states using subject-independent machine-learning techniques. As a result, the LSTM network achieved the highest classification accuracy of 81.46% for six emotional states, while the SVM network achieved only 68.64%. In addition, we achieved 82.89% accuracy in the Bi-LSTM network with two layers when applying the deep learning methods to different layers. In conclusion, extensive experiments were conducted on our collected dataset. Experimental results indicate that the LSTM network, a time-sequence-related model, has superior classification results of 82.89% than other methods. It also shows that the long duration of EEG signals is crucial for detecting the emotional state changes of various subject types, including individual subjects and cross-subjects. In future research, we will investigate multiple evaluation experiments utilizing deep learning models or propose novel EEG-based emotion classification features to improve the accuracy of emotion classification.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: nan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"28BAUX48","journalArticle","","Desai Maansi, Holder Jade","Generalizable EEG Encoding Models with Naturalistic Audiovisual Stimuli.","","","","10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2891-20.2021","","In natural conversations, listeners must attend to what others are saying while ignoring extraneous background sounds. Recent studies have used encoding models to predict electroencephalography (EEG) responses to speech in noise-free listening situations, sometimes referred to as speech tracking. Researchers have analyzed how speech tracking changes with different types of background noise. It is unclear, however, whether neural responses from acoustically rich, naturalistic environments with and without background noise can be generalized to more controlled stimuli. If encoding models for acoustically rich, naturalistic stimuli are generalizable to other tasks, this could aid in data collection from populations of individuals who may not tolerate listening to more controlled and less engaging stimuli for long periods of time. We recorded noninvasive scalp EEG while 17 human participants (8 male/9 female) listened to speech without noise and audiovisual speech stimuli containing overlapping speakers and background sounds. We fit multivariate temporal receptive field encoding models to predict EEG responses to pitch, the acoustic envelope, phonological features, and visual cues in both stimulus conditions. Our results suggested that neural responses to naturalistic stimuli were generalizable to more controlled datasets. EEG responses to speech in isolation were predicted accurately using phonological features alone, while responses to speech in a rich acoustic background were more accurate when including both phonological and acoustic features. Our findings suggest that naturalistic audiovisual stimuli can be used to measure receptive fields that are comparable and generalizable to more controlled audio-only stimuli.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding spoken language in natural environments requires listeners to parse acoustic and linguistic information in the presence of other distracting stimuli. However, most studies of auditory processing rely on highly controlled stimuli with no background noise, or with background noise inserted at specific times. Here, we compare models where EEG data are predicted based on a combination of acoustic, phonetic, and visual features in highly disparate stimuli-sentences from a speech corpus and speech embedded within movie trailers. We show that modeling neural responses to highly noisy, audiovisual movies can uncover tuning for acoustic and phonetic information that generalizes to simpler stimuli typically used in sensory neuroscience experiments.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 34503996.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a method for measuring neural data to assess the degree of similarity between multiple brains experiencing the same advertisements, and we demonstrate that this similarity can predict important marketing outcomes. Since neural data can be sampled continuously throughout an experience and without effort and conscious reporting biases, our method offers a useful complement to measures requiring active evaluations, such as subjective ratings and willingness-to-pay (WTP) scores. As a case study, we use portable electroencephalography (EEG) systems to record the brain activity of 58 moviegoers in a commercial theater and then calculate the relative levels of neural similarity, cross-brain correlation (CBC), throughout 13 movie trailers. Our initial evidence suggests that CBC predicts future free recall of the movie trailers and population-level sales of the corresponding movies. Additionally, since there are potentially other (i.e., non-neural) sources of physiological similarity (e.g., basic arousal), we illustrate how to use other passive measures, such as cardiac, respiratory, and electrodermal activity levels, to reject alternative hypotheses. Moreover, we show how CBC can be used in conjunction with empirical content analysis (e.g., levels of visual and semantic complexity).","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: nan","","","","EEG/MEG; Marketing Predictions w/ Neural Correlates; Short Clips; Subjective Rating","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these regions, neural patterns are relatively stable during events and shift at event boundaries. Music, like narratives, contains hierarchical event structure (e.g., sections are composed of phrases). Here, we tested the hypothesis that brain activity patterns in default mode regions reflect the high-level event structure of music. We used fMRI to record brain activity from 25 participants (male and female) as they listened to a continuous playlist of 16 musical excerpts and additionally collected annotations for these excerpts by asking a separate group of participants to mark when meaningful changes occurred in each one. We then identified temporal boundaries between stable patterns of brain activity using a hidden Markov model and compared the location of the model boundaries to the location of the human annotations. We identified multiple brain regions with significant matches to the observer-identified boundaries, including auditory cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and angular gyrus. From these results, we conclude that both higher-order and sensory areas contain information relating to the high-level event structure of music. Moreover, the higher-order areas in this study overlap with areas found in previous studies of event perception in movies and audio narratives, including regions in the default mode network.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35015874.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated systematic relationships between resting-state and task-induced functional connectivity (FC). In particular, continuous task studies, such as movie watching, speak to alterations in coupling among cortical regions and enhanced fluctuations in FC compared to the resting-state. This suggests that FC may reflect systematic and large-scale reorganization of functionally integrated responses while subjects are watching movies. In this study, we characterized fluctuations in FC during resting-state and movie-watching conditions. We found that the FC patterns induced systematically by movie-watching can be explained with a single principal component. These condition-specific FC fluctuations overlapped with inter-subject synchronization patterns in occipital and temporal brain regions. However, unlike inter-subject synchronization, condition-specific FC patterns were characterized by increased correlations within frontal brain regions and reduced correlations between frontal-parietal brain regions. We investigated these condition-specific functional variations as a shorter time scale, using time-resolved FC. The time-resolved FC showed condition-specificity over time; notably when subjects watched both the same and different movies. To explain self-organisation of global FC through the alterations in local dynamics, we used a large-scale computational model. We found that condition-specific reorganization of FC could be explained by local changes that engendered changes in FC among higher-order association regions, mainly in frontal and parietal cortices.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:08:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 30237036.0","<p>Look at computational model?</p>","","","fMRI; Functional Connectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robust neuromagnetic brain activity of auditory mismatch-related perception occurs in response to non-prototypical vowels in across-category contrasts for first-language speakers. However, whether this non-prototypicality effect applies to within-category vowel perception remains to be elucidated. Here, healthy Japanese adults (n = 7) were subjected to magnetoencephalography (MEG) while watching a silent movie, and passively listened to synthesized English vowels /i/. We observed the source-level mismatch effect to the mid-high near-front vowel deviant [?] with the most non-prototypical, unspecified feature in the participants' native language system. The mismatch effect recruited the left posterior superior temporal sulcus with a peak latency of 225 ms post-stimulus onset. We further studied whether a longer F1 distance between vowel pairs would increase mismatch-activated intensities, however, we did not observe neuromagnetic changes when the prototypical anchor standard [i] was compared with three non-prototypical deviants differing in first resonance frequency (F1) values. Our results indicate that an F1 increase in within-category upper front vowel perception is a strong activator of mismatch responses measured by source-level activated intensities for non-native listeners.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33438089.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the human brain, common fMRI methods such as cluster correction, atlas parcellation, and anatomical searchlight are biased by design toward finding localized representations. Here we introduce the functional searchlight approach as an alternative to anatomical searchlight analysis, the most commonly used exploratory multivariate fMRI technique. Functional searchlight removes any anatomical bias by grouping voxels based only on functional similarity and ignoring anatomical proximity. We report evidence that visual and auditory features from deep neural networks and semantic features from a natural language processing model, as well as object representations, are more widely distributed across the brain than previously acknowledged and that functional searchlight can improve model-based similarity and decoding accuracy. This approach provides a new way to evaluate and constrain computational models with brain activity and pushes our understanding of human brain function further along the spectrum from strict modularity toward distributed representationAuthor summaryThere are two classical views about how the mind is organized in the brain. Early phrenology and neurophysiology and later neuropsychology argued that brain regions are specialized for certain functions of the mind. Older behavioral neuroscience and more recent neural network modeling and pattern classification instead argued against a one-to-one mapping, and rather that functions of the mind are distributed across multiple brain regions. Although there is considerable evidence for both perspectives in modern cognitive neuroscience, we hypothesize that the degree to which functions are distributed has been underestimated because of biases in prior work that favored finding specialized regions. Our novel machine learning approach, functional searchlight, reveals that features of a movie extracted with three different types of computational model and object representations are more widely distributed in the brain than suggested by current methods. Moreover, these distributed representations carry more movie content than could previously be decoded from the brain. This suggests a better way to conduct model-based analysis of brain data and provides a more solid basis on which to evaluate and refine theoretical models.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33270655.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this longitudinal study, 76 typically developing infants were studied (age: 4-14 months, 166 individual study visits) over the course of 6 months with one, two, three, or four lab visits. Habitual sleep was measured with a 7-day sleep diary and actigraphy, and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Twenty-channel EEG was recorded while infants watched multiple rounds of videos of women singing nursery rhymes; oscillatory power in the theta band was extracted. Key metrics were average theta across stimuli and the slope of change in theta within the first novel movie. Both objective and subjective sleep assessment methods showed a relationship between more night waking and higher overall theta power and reduced dynamic modulation of theta over the course of the novel video stimuli. These results may indicate altered learning and consolidation in infants with more disrupted night sleep, which may have implications for cognitive development.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 36426793.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neuroimaging paradigms employing dynamic natural stimuli alleviate the anxiety often associated with complex tasks and eschew the need for laboratorystyle abstractions, hence providing an ecologically valid means of elucidating neural underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders. To probe the neurobiological signature of refined depression subtypes, we acquired functional neuroimaging data in patients with the melancholic subtype of major depressive disorder during free viewing of emotionally salient films. We found a marked disengagement of ventromedial prefrontal cortex during natural viewing of a film with negative emotional valence in patients with melancholia. This effect significantly correlated with depression severity. Such changes occurred on the background of diminished consistency of neural activity in visual and auditory sensory networks, as well as higher-order networks involved in emotion and attention, including bilateral intraparietal sulcus and right anterior insula. These findings may reflect a failure to reallocate resources and diminished reactivity to external emotional stimuli in melancholia.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 26112251.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In one experiment, the subjects viewed sexual and nonsexual film clips, and dynamic annotations for nudity in the clips were used to predict hemodynamic activity. In the second experiment, the subjects viewed sexual and nonsexual pictures in an event-related design. Men showed stronger activation than women in the visual and prefrontal cortices and dorsal attention network in both experiments. Furthermore, using multivariate pattern classification we could accurately predict the sex of the subject on the basis of the brain activity elicited by the sexual stimuli. The classification generalized across the experiments indicating that the sex differences were task-independent. Eye tracking data obtained from an independent sample of subjects (N = 110) showed that men looked longer than women at the chest area of the nude female actors in the film clips.

However, to date MVPA studies that have actually explored fMRI resolutions at less than 2 mm voxel size are rare and limited to small sets of unnatural stimuli (like visual gratings) as well as specific sub-regions of the brain, notably the primary somatosensory cortices. To investigate what spatial scale best supports high information extraction under more general conditions this study combined naturalistic movie stimuli with high-resolution fMRI at 7 T and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of global and local BOLD signal patterns.Contrary to predictions, LDA and similar classifiers reached a maximum in classification accuracy (CA) at a smoothed resolution close to 3 mm, well above the 1.2 mm voxel size of the fMRI acquisition. Maximal CAs around 90% were contingent upon global fMRI signal patterns comprising 4 k-16 k of the most reactive voxels distributed sparsely throughout the occipital and ventro-temporal cortices. A Searchlight analysis of local fMRI patterns largely confirmed the global results, but also revealed a small subset of brain regions in early visual cortex showing limited increases in CA with higher resolution. Principal component analysis of the global and local fMRI signal patterns suggested that reproducible neuronal contributions were spatially auto-correlated and smooth, while other components of higher spatial frequency were likely related to physiological noise and responsible for the reduced CA at higher resolution. Systematic differences between experiments and subjects suggested that higher CA was significantly correlated with more consistent behavior revealed by eye tracking. Thus, the optimal resolution of fMRI data for MVPA was mainly limited by physiological noise of high spatial frequency as well as behavioral (in-)consistency.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:09:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 28842385.0","","","","fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this reduction, BOLD activity in retrieval-related regions was positively correlated with recognition accuracy only after months. Hippocampal engagement during retrieval remained similar over time during recall but decreased in recognition. Our results are in line with the hypothesis that hippocampus subserves retrieval of real-life episodic memory long after encoding, its engagement being dependent on retrieval demands.

We asked whether there is a common neural code that underpins similar conscious experiences, which could be used to decode these experiences in the absence of behavior. To this end, we used richly evocative stimulation (an engaging movie) portraying real-world events to elicit a similar conscious experience in different people. Common neural correlates of conscious experience were quantified and related to measurable, quantitative and qualitative, executive components of the movie through two additional behavioral investigations. The movie's executive demands drove synchronized brain activity across healthy participants' frontal and parietal cortices in regions known to support executive function. Moreover, the timing of activity in these regions was predicted by participants' highly similar qualitative experience of the movie's moment-to-moment executive demands, suggesting that synchronization of activity across participants underpinned their similar experience. Thus we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that a neural index based on executive function reliably predicted every healthy individual's similar conscious experience in response to real-world events unfolding over time. This approach provided strong evidence for the conscious experience of a brain-injured patient, who had remained entirely behaviorally nonresponsive for 16 y. The patient's executive engagement and moment-to-moment perception of the movie content were highly similar to that of every healthy participant. These findings shed light on the common basis of human consciousness and enable the interpretation of conscious experience in the absence of behavior.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 25225384.0","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>!!This one is actually on the BANG! movie!! abs + quick fig</p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","C:\Users\Etudiant\Zotero\storage\WXKVIS8G\Naci Lorina - A common neural code for similar conscious experie.pdf","","fMRI; Movie Segmentation; Neural Correlates of Shared Conscious Experience; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a test-retest approach to examine whether the naturalistic paradigm reliably represents inter-individual differences, which brain regions have the superior capability, and whether the ability alters with the contents of the stimuli. We quantified the reliability of the inter-subject relationships in repeated scans of two movie clips: a natural sight view and an emotion-evoking story. Besides statistical inference, we included resting-state scans, behavioral tests, and questionnaires as references for the comparison. The results showed that over one-third area of the brain could reliably characterize the inter-individual relationship, and the superior temporal lobe demonstrated comparable reliability representation with the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Furthermore, the temporal lobe regions could retain this capability across emotional movies with different contents. This study provides a base for pushing the naturalistic imaging paradigm towards clinical applications and proposes reliable target brain regions for future studies.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 32818614.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies using electrophysiology and functional MRI techniques have reported that tasks requiring visual object recognition elicited cortical activation sequentially in the aforementioned posterior visual regions and FEFs. The present study aims to provide unique evidence of direct effective connectivity outgoing from the posterior visual regions by measuring the early component (10-50 ms) of cortico-cortical spectral responses (CCSRs) elicited by weak single-pulse direct cortical electrical stimulation. We studied 22 patients who underwent extraoperative intracranial EEG recording for clinical localization of seizure foci and functionally-important brain regions. We used animations to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of gamma band CCSRs elicited by stimulation of three different posterior visual regions. We quantified the strength of CCSR-defined effective connectivity between the lower- and higher-order posterior visual regions as well as from the posterior visual regions to the FEFs. We found that effective connectivity within the posterior visual regions was larger in the feedforward (i.e., lower-to higher-order) direction compared to the opposite direction. Specifically, connectivity from the medial-occipital region was largest to the lateral-occipital region, whereas that from the lateral-occipital region was largest to the fusiform region. Among the posterior visual regions, connectivity to the FEF was largest from the lateral-occipital region and the mean peak latency of CCSR propagation from the lateral-occipital region to FEF was 26 ms. Our invasive study of the human brain using a stimulation-based intervention supports the model that the posterior visual regions have direct cortico-cortical connectivity pathways in which neural activity is transferred preferentially from the lower-to higher-order areas. The human brain has direct cortico-cortical connectivity allowing a rapid transfer of neural activity from the lateral-occipital region to the FEF.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31958582.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This suggests that people draw on prior memories when empathizing, but the mechanisms underlying this connection remain largely unexplored. The present study investigates how variations in episodic information shape the emotional response towards a movie character. Episodic information is either absent or provided by a written context preceding empathic film clips. It was shown that sad context information increases empathic concern for a movie character. This was tracked by neural activity in the temporal pole (TP) and anterior hippocampus (aHP). Dynamic causal modeling with Bayesian Model Selection has shown that context changes the effective connectivity from left aHP to the right TP. The same crossed-hemispheric coupling was found during rest, when people are left to their own thoughts. We conclude that (i) that the integration of episodic memory also supports the specific case of integrating context into empathic judgments, (ii) the right TP supports emotion processing by integrating episodic memory into empathic inferences, and (iii) lateral integration is a key process for episodic simulation during rest and during task. We propose that a disruption of the mechanism may underlie empathy deficits in clinical conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29925874.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biofeedback training designed to alter the asymmetry of frontal brain activity was therefore examined. Eighteen right-handed female participants were randomly assigned to receive biofeedback training designed to increase right frontal alpha relative to left frontal alpha (n = 9) or to receive training in the opposite direction (n = 9). Five consecutive days of biofeedback training provided signals of reward or nonreward depending on whether the difference between right (F4) and left (F3) frontal alpha exceeded a criterion value in the specified direction.

However, what accounts for such differences remains unclear. Brain activity during a task reflects an unknown mixture of spontaneous and task-evoked activities. The difference in functional connectivity between a task state and the resting state may reflect not only task-evoked functional connectivity, but also changes in spontaneously emerging networks. Here, we characterized the differences in apparent functional connectivity between the resting state and when human subjects were watching a naturalistic movie. Such differences were marginally explained by the task-evoked functional connectivity involved in processing the movie content. Instead, they were mostly attributable to changes in spontaneous networks driven by ongoing activity during the task. The execution of the task reduced the correlations in ongoing activity among different cortical networks, especially between the visual and non-visual sensory or motor cortices. Our results suggest that task-evoked activity is not independent from spontaneous activity, and that engaging in a task may suppress spontaneous activity and its inter-regional correlation.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 30144210.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous imaging studies examined brain activity associated with the processing of cinematographic material using both standard condition-based designs, as well as computational methods based on the extraction of time-varying features of the stimuli (e.g. motion). Here, we exploited both approaches to investigate the neural correlates of complex visual and auditory spatial signals in cinematography. In the first experiment, the participants watched a piece of a commercial movie presented in four blocked conditions: 3D vision with surround sounds (3D-Surround), 3D with monaural sound (3D-Mono), 2D-Surround, and 2D-Mono. In the second experiment, they watched two different segments of the movie both presented continuously in 3D-Surround. The blocked presentation served for standard condition-based analyses, while all datasets were submitted to computation-based analyses. The latter assessed where activity co-varied with visual disparity signals and the complexity of auditory multi-sources signals. The blocked analyses associated 3D viewing with the activation of the dorsal and lateral occipital cortex and superior parietal lobule, while the surround sounds activated the superior and middle temporal gyri (S/MTG). The computation-based analyses revealed the effects of absolute disparity in dorsal occipital and posterior parietal cortices and of disparity gradients in the posterior middle temporal gyrus plus the inferior frontal gyrus. The complexity of the surround sounds was associated with activity in specific sub-regions of S/MTG, even after accounting for changes of sound intensity. These results demonstrate that the processing of naturalistic audio-visual signals entails an extensive set of visual and auditory areas, and that computation-based analyses can track the contribution of complex spatial aspects characterizing such life-like stimuli.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 24194828.0","","C:\Users\Etudiant\Zotero\storage\ZRTK23GV\Ogawa Akitoshi - Audio-Visual Perception of 3D Cinematography An f.pdf","","Event Boundaries; Modified Movie Stimulus; Neural Correlates of Shared Conscious Experience; Plurimodality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has not been fully studied whether there are differences in the activation effect between these two continuous display modes on emotional arousal and what characteristics of the related neural activity are. In this paper, we designed a cognitive psychology experiment in order to compare the effects of VR-2D and VR-3D on emotional arousal by analyzing synchronously collected scalp electroencephalogram signals. We used support vector machine (SVM) to verify the neurophysiological differences between the two modes in VR environment. The results showed that compared with VR-2D films, VR-3D films evoked significantly higher electroencephalogram (EEG) power (mainly reflected in alpha and beta activities). The significantly improved beta wave power in VR-3D mode showed that 3D vision brought more intense cortical activity, which might lead to higher arousal. At the same time, the more intense alpha activity in the occipital region of the brain also suggested that VR-3D films might cause higher visual fatigue. By the means of neurocinematics, this paper demonstrates that EEG activity can well reflect the effects of different vision modes on the characteristics of the viewers' neural activities. The current study provides theoretical support not only for the future exploration of the image language under the VR perspective, but for future VR film shooting methods and human emotion research.在虚拟现实（VR）环境中展示全景电影有两种模式，非立体视觉模式（2D）和立体视觉模式（3D），这两种不同的连续播放模式对情绪唤醒的激活效果是否存在差异以及相关的神经活动特性尚未得到充分的研究。本文通过设计认知心理学实验，分析同步采集的头皮脑电信号，对比研究了VR-2D和VR-3D视觉模式对情绪唤醒的影响，并利用支持向量机验证VR-2D与VR-3D模式神经生理特征的差异。结果发现，VR-3D影片诱发出的脑电能量显著高于VR-2D影片（主要体现在alpha和beta活动上），VR-3D模式下显著提高的beta波能量表明立体视觉带来了更强烈的大脑皮层活动，可能引发了被试者更高的唤醒度；与此同时，大脑枕区更强烈的alpha活动也暗示着VR-3D影片可能引发了更高的视觉疲劳度。本文利用神经电影学的研究方法发现脑电活动可以很好地反映不同观影模式对于观影者相关神经活动特性的影响，为今后进一步探索VR视角下的影像语言，为未来VR电影的拍摄方式和人的情绪研究提供了理论支撑。.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35231966.0","","","","EEG/MEG; Modified Movie Stimulus; Neurocinematics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The processes that give rise to correlated activity are, however, poorly understood. Here we decompose resting-state functional connectivity using a temporal unwrapping procedure to assess the contributions of moment-to-moment activity cofluctuations to the overall connectivity pattern. This approach temporally resolves functional connectivity at a timescale of single frames, which enables us to make direct comparisons of cofluctuations of network organization with fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series. We show that surprisingly, only a small fraction of frames exhibiting the strongest cofluctuation amplitude are required to explain a significant fraction of variance in the overall pattern of connection weights as well as the network's modular structure. These frames coincide with frames of high BOLD activity amplitude, corresponding to activity patterns that are remarkably consistent across individuals and identify fluctuations in default mode and control network activity as the primary driver of resting-state functional connectivity. Finally, we demonstrate that cofluctuation amplitude synchronizes across subjects during movie watching and that high-amplitude frames carry detailed information about individual subjects (whereas low-amplitude frames carry little). Our approach reveals fine-scale temporal structure of resting-state functional connectivity and discloses that frame-wise contributions vary across time. These observations illuminate the relation of brain activity to functional connectivity and open a number of directions for future research.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 33093200.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instead of basing alignment on functionally defined areas, whose location is defined as the center of mass or the local maximum response, the alignment is based on patterns of response as they are distributed spatially both within and across cortical areas. The method is implemented in the two-dimensional manifold of an inflated, spherical cortical surface.

These advances include discovering a cortical hierarchy of temporal receptive windows, which supports processing of dynamic information that accumulates over several time scales, such as immediate reactions vs. slowly emerging patterns in social interactions. Naturalistic stimuli have also helped elucidate how the hippocampus supports segmentation and memorization of events in day-to-day life and have afforded insights into attentional brain mechanisms underlying our ability to adopt specific perspectives during natural viewing. Further, neuroimaging studies with naturalistic stimuli have revealed the role of the default-mode network in narrative-processing and in social cognition.

The current study elicited two positive emotions (amusement and tenderness) and two negative emotions (anger and fear) that are similar in both valence and arousal dimensions to examine the differences in brain activities in these emotional states. Frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry and midline power in three bands (theta, alpha and beta) were measured when participants watched affective film excerpts. Significant differences were detected between tenderness and amusement on FP1/FP2 theta asymmetry, F3/F4 theta and alpha asymmetry. Significant differences between anger and fear on FP1/FP2 theta asymmetry and F3/F4 alpha asymmetry were also observed. For midline power, midline theta power could distinguish two negative emotions, while midline alpha and beta power could effectively differentiate two positive emotions. Liking and dominance were also related to EEG features. Stepwise multiple linear regression results revealed that frontal alpha and theta asymmetry could predict the subjective feelings of two positive and two negative emotions in different patterns. The binary classification accuracy, which used EEG frontal asymmetry and midline power as features and support vector machine (SVM) as classifiers, was as high as 64.52% for tenderness and amusement and 78.79% for anger and fear. The classification accuracy was improved after adding these features to other features extracted across the scalp. These findings indicate that frontal EEG asymmetry and midline power might have the potential to recognize discrete emotions that are similar in the valence-arousal coordinate space.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 30443208.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 62-channel EEG was recorded in control (n=21) and high anxiety (HA, n=18) non-patient individuals. Results showed that in HA subjects, the lowest level of arousal (eyes closed) was associated with stronger right-sided parieto-temporal theta-1 (4-6 Hz) and beta-1 (12-18 Hz) activity, whereas increased non-emotional arousal (eyes open, viewing neutral movie clip) was marked by persisting favored right hemisphere beta-1 activity. In turn, viewing aversive movie clip by the HA group led to significant lateralized decrease of the right parieto-temporal beta-1 power, which was initially higher in the emotionally neutral conditions.

We observed a time-averaged social-emotion interaction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, although this region did not demonstrate synchrony effects. Alternatively, social-emotion interactions in the amygdala and superior temporal sulcus showed greater neural synchrony in the joint compared to solo conditions during positive videos, but the opposite pattern for negative videos.

In this paper, the deep belief network (DBN) was utilized to classify three category emotions through the electroencephalograph (EEG) and facial expressions. Signals from 15 deaf subjects were recorded when they watched the emotional movie clips. Our system uses a 1-s window without overlap to segment the EEG signals in five frequency bands, then the differential entropy (DE) feature is extracted.

The results show that the classification accuracy is 99.92% by feature selection in deaf emotion reignition.

In examining this question with functional neuroimaging, we found that brain activity reorganizes in a hybrid, scale-dependent manner when individuals processed the same audiovisual narrative a second time. At the most local level, sensory systems (occipital and temporal cortices) maintained a similar temporal activation profile during the two viewings. Nonetheless, functional connectivity between these same lateral temporal regions and other brain regions was stronger during the second viewing. Furthermore, at the level of whole-brain connectivity, we found a significant rearrangement of network partition structure: lateral temporal and inferior frontal regions clustered together during the first viewing but merged within a fronto-parietal cluster in the second. Our findings show that repetition maintains local activity profiles.

Traditional approaches (which involve pilot test-screenings, questionnaires, and focus groups) have reached a plateau in their ability to predict the population-wide responses to new movies. In this study, we develop a novel computational approach for extracting neurophysiological electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-gaze based metrics to predict the population-wide behavior of movie goers. We further, explore the connection of the derived metrics to the underlying cognitive processes that might drive moviegoers' decision to watch a movie. Towards that, we recorded neural activity-through the use of EEG-and eye-gaze activity from a group of naive individuals while watching movie trailers of pre-selected movies for which the population-wide preference is captured by the movie's market performance (i.e., box-office ticket sales in the US). Our findings show that the neural based metrics, derived using the proposed methodology, carry predictive information about the broader audience decisions to watch a movie, above and beyond traditional methods. In particular, neural metrics are shown to predict up to 72% of the variance of the films' performance at their premiere and up to 67% of the variance at following weekends; which corresponds to a 23-fold increase in prediction accuracy compared to current neurophysiological or traditional methods. We discuss our findings in the context of existing literature and hypothesize on the possible connection of the derived neurophysiological metrics to cognitive states of focused attention, the encoding of long-term memory, and the synchronization of different components of the brain's rewards network. Beyond the practical implication in predicting and understanding the behavior of moviegoers, the proposed approach can facilitate the use of video stimuli in neuroscience research; such as the study of individual differences in attention-deficit disorders, and the study of desensitization to media violence.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29311885.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested whether positive and negative events generate lingering changes in subsequent brain responses to unrelated threat stimuli and investigated the impact of individual anxiety. We acquired fMRI data while participants watched positive or negative movie-clips and subsequently performed an unrelated task with fearful and neutral faces. We quantified changes in amygdala reactivity to fearful faces as a function of the valence of preceding movies and cumulative neural activity evoked during them. We demonstrate that amygdala responses to emotional movies spill over to subsequent processing of threat information in a valence-specific manner: negative movies enhance later amygdala activation whereas positive movies attenuate it. Critically, the magnitude of such changes is predicted by a measure of cumulative amygdala responses to the preceding positive or negative movies. These effects appear independent of overt attention, are regionally limited to amygdala, with no changes in functional connectivity. Finally, individuals with higher state anxiety displayed stronger modulation of amygdala reactivity by positive movies. These results suggest that intensity and valence of emotional events as well as anxiety levels promote local changes in amygdala sensitivity to threat, highlighting the importance of past experience in shaping future affective reactivity.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:12:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 24603023.0","","","","fMRI; Inertia; Short Clips","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate the developmental process of auditory habituation, the current study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate auditory habituation, dishabituation and stimulus specificity in children and adults and compared the results between age groups. Twenty-nine children (M-age = 9.69 years, SD +/- 0.47) and 14 adults (M-age = 29.29 years, SD +/- 3.47) participated in the study and passively listened to a habituation paradigm consisting of 100 trains of tones which were composed of five 500 Hz tones, one 750 Hz tone (dishabituator) and another two 500 Hz tones, respectively while focusing their attention on a silent movie. Adults showed the expected habituation and stimulus specificity within-trains while no response decrement was found between trains. Sensory adaptation or fatigue as a source for response decrement in adults is unlikely due to the strong reaction to the dishabituator (stimulus specificity) and strong mismatch negativity (MMN) responses. However, in children neither habituation nor dishabituation or stimulus specificity could be found within-trains, response decrement was found across trains. It can be speculated that the differences between children and adults are linked to differences in stimulus processing due to attentional processes. This study shows developmental differences in task-related brain activation and discusses the possible influence of broader concepts such as attention, which should be taken into account when comparing performance in an identical task between age groups.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:06:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 23882207.0","","","","Movie As Secondary; OUT-OF-SCOPE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) as measured by electroencephalographic (EEG) power in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), is a sensitive indicator of asymmetric brain activity in the frontal cortex. The current study aimed to analyze the frontal EEG asymmetries in terms of valence and motivational direction. We presented 37 participants with three film excerpts that were selected from the standard emotional film database to elicit three target emotions: tenderness, anger, and neutrality. Participants' self-reports on their induced emotional responses and EEG signals were recorded and analyzed. The results showed that individuals displayed lower alpha power in the left hemisphere than the right hemisphere when they were watching a tender film, indicating that tenderness was positive and related to approach motivation. In contrast, when watching an angry movie, participants showed higher alpha power in the left hemisphere than the right hemisphere, suggesting that anger was negative and associated with withdrawal motivation. These findings help to link positive and approach-motivated tenderness with greater left hemispheric activation and state-anger with greater right hemispheric activation through the analysis of FAA.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29795119.0","","","","EEG/MEG; Emotional Topology; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have demonstrated that cross-modal information can modulate neural encoding of low-level sensory features. These studies, however, mostly focus on the processing of single sensory events or rhythmic sensory sequences. Here, we investigate how the neural encoding of basic auditory and visual features is modulated by cross-modal information when the participants watch movie clips primarily composed of non-rhythmic events. We presented audiovisual congruent and audiovisual incongruent movie clips, and since attention can modulate cross-modal interactions, we separately analyzed high-and low-arousal movie clips. We recorded neural responses using electroencephalography (EEG), and employed the temporal response function (TRF) to quantify the neural encoding of auditory and visual features. The neural encoding of sound envelope is enhanced in the audiovisual congruent condition than the incongruent condition, but this effect is only significant for high-arousal movie clips. In contrast, audiovisual congruency does not significantly modulate the neural encoding of visual features, e.g., luminance or visual motion. In summary, our findings demonstrate asymmetrical cross-modal interactions during the processing of natural scenes that lack rhythmicity: Congruent visual information enhances low-level auditory processing, while congruent auditory information does not significantly modulate low-level visual processing.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:08:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35395403.0","","","","EEG/MEG; Emotional Topology; Plurimodality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"EIZLJ7EY","journalArticle","","Somech Noam, Mizrahi Tamar","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy imaging of the prefrontal cortex during a naturalistic comedy movie","","","","10.3389/fnins.2022.913540","","Naturalistic stimulation (i.e., movies and auditory narratives of some minutes' length) has been a powerful approach to bringing more real-life experiences into laboratory experiments. Data-driven, intersubject correlation (ISC) analysis permits examining to what extent activity in a specific brain region correlates across participants during exposure to a naturalistic stimulus, as well as testing whether neural activity correlates with behavioral measures. Notably, most of the previous research with naturalistic stimuli was conducted using functional fMRI (fMRI). Here, we tested whether a naturalistic approach and the ISC are feasible using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) - the imaging method particularly suited for populations of patients and children. Fifty-three healthy adult participants watched twice a 3-min segment of a Charlie Chaplin movie while we recorded the brain activity on the surface of their prefrontal cortex using fNIRS. In addition, an independent group of 18 participants used a continuous scoring procedure to rate the extent to which they felt that different parts of the movie fragment were funny. Our two findings were as follows. First, we found higher-than-zero ISC in fNIRS signals in the prefrontal cortex lobes, a result that was particularly high in the oxygenated channels during the first repetition of the movie. Second, we found a significant negative correlation between oxygenated brain signals and ratings of the movie's humorousness. In a series of control analyses we demonstrated that this latter correlation could not be explained by various non-humor-related movie sensory properties (e.g., auditory volume and image brightness). The key overall outcome of the present study is that fNIRS in combination with the naturalistic paradigms and the ISC might be a sensitive and powerful research method to explore cognitive processing. Our results also suggest a potential role of the prefrontal cortex in humor appreciation.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 36161175.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Encoding models that predict neural responses to arbitrary stimuli can be very useful for studying brain function. However, existing models focus on limited aspects of naturalistic stimuli, ignoring the dynamic interactions of modalities in this inherently context-rich paradigm. Using movie-watching data from the Human Connectome Project, we build group-level models of neural activity that incorporate several inductive biases about neural information processing, including hierarchical processing, temporal assimilation, and auditory-visual interactions. We demonstrate how incorporating these biases leads to remarkable prediction performance across large areas of the cortex, beyond the sensory-specific cortices into multisensory sites and frontal cortex. Furthermore, we illustrate that encoding models learn high-level concepts that generalize to task-bound paradigms. Together, our findings underscore the potential of encoding models as powerful tools for studying brain function in ecologically valid conditions.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 14:52:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 34049888.0","","","","Neural Correlates of Shared Conscious Experience; Predicting Neural Corr. w/ Encoding Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The starting hypothesis is that viewers' response to cuts varies depending on whether they watch a movie with a classical versus a messy or chaotic editing style. To undertake this investigation, we created three videos with the same narrative content and duration but different editing styles. One video was a fixed one-shot movie. Another video followed a classical editing style, based on the rules of classic Hollywood movies, according to David Bordwell's studies. The other video used a chaotic style, beyond post-classic, which broke the classical rules of continuity and was inspired by music video clips. We showed these stimuli to 40 subjects while recording their brain activity using the electroencephalography (EEG) technique. The results showed that cuts reduce the eyeblink frequency during the second after they are seen. Since blinking is a well-known attention marker, we propose that cuts increase viewers' attention. Cuts initiate a flow of electrical activity from the visual cortex to the cognitive processing zone in the prefrontal area. We also found that the different editing styles in which cuts are inserted affected perception, confirming the initial hypothesis. These results could be of great interest and utility for creators of audiovisual content and the management of attention in their work.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: nan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New VR devices, such as the Meta (Oculus) Quest, have expanded the possibilities for viewing movies. The purpose of this study is to compare the emotional and cognitive impacts of VR and traditional 2D movies. In this study, sixty volunteers were divided into two groups and presented a movie (Gala) in 2D or VR format. We employed a multimodal method to assess the cognitive and emotional effects of the film both during and after watching. Our technique combined self-reports, interviews, questionnaires, and objective heart rate and EEG brain activity data. After quantitative and qualitative evaluation, it was discovered, that regardless of media, there was a substantial influence of the movie on the emotional state of the participant's mood. Moreover, compared to the traditional 2D-movie, the VR movie led to more consistent and robust positive effect on all aspects of self-rated affect. The difference in self-reported mood was corroborated by reduced EEG amplitudes in the beta frequency band, indicating higher levels of positive affectivity, which was only observed for the VR movie. Lastly, the VR movie also leads to overall higher self-rated immersion and engagement than the 2D version. Our results highlight the potential of VR movies to engage and emotionally affect audiences beyond traditional cinema. Moreover, our study highlights the value of using a multidisciplinary method for analysing audience impacts.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: nan","","","","EEG/MEG; Modified Movie Stimulus; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, neurocognitive processes associated with the perception of stereoscopic depth in complex and dynamic visual stimuli remain understudied. Here, we investigate the influence of stereoscopic depth on both neurophysiology and subjective experience. Using multivariate statistical learning methods, we compare the brain activity of subjects when freely watching the same movies in 2D and in 3D. Subjective reports indicate that 3D movies are more strongly experienced than 2D movies. On the neural level, we observe significantly higher intersubject correlations of cortical networks when subjects are watching 3D movies relative to the same movies in 2D. We demonstrate that increases in intersubject correlations of brain networks can serve as neurophysiological marker for stereoscopic depth and for the strength of the viewing experience.

In the quiet conditions, a single speech stream was presented and the subjects paid attention to the speech stream (active listening) or watched a silent movie instead (passive listening). In the competing speaker (CS) conditions, two speakers of opposite genders were presented diotically. Ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were measured in each condition and cross-correlated with the speech envelope of each speaker at different time lags. In quiet, active and passive listening resulted in similar neural responses to the speech envelope. In the CS conditions, however, the shape of the cross-correlation function was remarkably different between the attended and unattended speech. The cross-correlation with the attended speech showed stronger N1 and P2 responses but a weaker P1 response compared to the cross-correlation with the unattended speech. Furthermore, the N1 response to the attended speech in the CS condition was enhanced and delayed compared with the active listening condition in quiet, while the P2 response to the unattended speaker in the CS condition was attenuated compared with the passive listening in quiet. Taken together, these results demonstrate that top-down attention differentially modulates envelope-tracking neural activity at different time lags and suggest that top-down attention can both enhance the neural responses to the attended sound stream and suppress the responses to the unattended sound stream.

A growing body of research has proposed neural envelope tracking as an objective measure of speech intelligibility, particularly for individuals unable to provide reliable behavioral feedback. However, its potential for evaluating speech intelligibility and hearing aid benefit in children with hearing loss remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated neural envelope tracking in children with permanent hearing loss through two separate experiments. EEG data were recorded while children listened to age-appropriate stories (Experiment 1) or an animated movie (Experiment 2) under aided and unaided conditions (using personal hearing aids) at multiple stimulus intensities. Neural envelope tracking was evaluated using a linear decoder reconstructing the speech envelope from the EEG in the delta band (0.5-4 Hz). Additionally, we calculated temporal response functions (TRFs) to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the response. In both experiments, neural tracking increased with increasing stimulus intensity, but only in the unaided condition. In the aided condition, neural tracking remained stable across a wide range of intensities, as long as speech intelligibility was maintained. Similarly, TRF amplitudes increased with increasing stimulus intensity in the unaided condition, while in the aided condition significant differences were found in TRF latency rather than TRF amplitude. This suggests that decreasing stimulus intensity does not necessarily impact neural tracking. Furthermore, the use of personal hearing aids significantly enhanced neural envelope tracking, particularly in challenging speech conditions that would be inaudible when unaided. Finally, we found a strong correlation between neural envelope tracking and behaviorally measured speech intelligibility for both narrated stories (Experiment 1) and movie stimuli (Experiment 2). Altogether, these findings indicate that neural envelope tracking could be a valuable tool for predicting speech intelligibility benefits derived from personal hearing aids in hearing-impaired children. Incorporating narrated stories or engaging movies expands the accessibility of these methods even in clinical settings, offering new avenues for using objective speech measures to guide pediatric audiology decision-making.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 37806102.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However previous studies have not examined the effect of extensive visual experience alone: for example, an art critic or dance fan who has a rich experience of watching dance but negligible experience performing dance. To explore the effect of pure visual experience we performed a single experiment using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to compare the neural processing of dance actions in 3 groups: a) 14 ballet dancers, b) 10 experienced viewers, c) 12 novices without any extensive dance or viewing experience.Each of the 36 participants viewed short 2-second displays of ballet derived from motion capture of a professional ballerina. These displays represented the ballerina as only points of light at the major joints. We wished to study the action observation network broadly and thus included two different types of display and two different tasks for participants to perform. The two different displays were: a) brief movies of a ballet action and b) frames from the ballet movies with the points of lights connected by lines to show a ballet posture. The two different tasks were: a) passively observe the display and b) imagine performing the action depicted in the display. The two levels of display and task were combined factorially to produce four experimental conditions (observe movie, observe posture, motor image, of movie, motor imagery of posture). The set of stimuli used in the experiment are available for download after this paper.A random effects ANOVA was performed on brain activity and an effect of experience was obtained in seven different brain areas including: right Temporoparietal junction (TPF), left Retrosplenial Cortex (RSC), right Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1), bilateral Primary Motor Cortex (M1), right Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC), right Temporal Pole (TP). The patterns of activation were plotted in each of these areas (TPF, RSC, S1, M1, OFC, TP) to investigate more closely how the effect of experience changed across these areas. For this analysis, novices were treated as baseline and the relative effect of experience examined in the dancer and experienced viewer groups.Interpretation of these results suggests that both visual and motor experience appear equivalent in producing more extensive early processing of dance actions in early stages of representation (TPF and RSC) and we hypothesise that this could be due to the involvement of autobiographical memory processes. The pattern of results found for dancers in S1 and M1 suggest that their perception of dance actions are enhanced by embodied processes. For example, the Si results are consistent with claims that this brain area shows mirror properties. The pattern of results found for the experienced viewers in OFC and TP suggests that their perception of dance actions are enhanced by cognitive processes. For example, involving aspects of social cognition and hedonic processing the experienced viewers find the motor imagery task more pleasant and have richer connections of dance to social memory. While aspects of our interpretation are speculative the core results clearly show common and distinct aspects of how viewing experience and physical experience shape brain responses to watching dance.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: nan","","","","fMRI; Modified Movie Stimulus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is unclear, however, how these two functions converge into one mechanism. Here, we tested whether increased activity with perceiving salient events is a deviant detection signal or contains information about the event associations by reflecting the magnitude of deviance (i.e., event saliency). We also tested how the deviant detection signal is affected by the degree of anticipation. We studied regional neural activity when people watched a movie that had varying saliency of a novel or an anticipated flow of salient events. Using intracranial electroencephalography from 10 patients, we observed that high-frequency activity (50-150 Hz) in the hippocampus, dorsolateral PFC, and medial OFC tracked event saliency. We also observed that medial OFC activity was stronger when the salient events were anticipated than when they were novel. These results suggest that dorsolateral PFC and medial OFC, as well as the hippocampus, signify the saliency magnitude of events, reflecting the hierarchical structure of event associations.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 30883290.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, ARSG can offer important, new insights into learning-related neural plasticity. However, little research has examined how the brain allocates cognitive resources in ARSG. By analyzing power spectrums and electroencephalograph (EEG) functional connectivity (FC) networks, this study compared multiple conditions (resting, movie watching, ARSG, and Life simulation gaming - LSG) in two experiments. Consistent with previous research, we found that brain waves appeared to be de-assimilated after activation. Furthermore, results showed that ARSG was associated with higher activation and workload as indicated by theta-waves, and required higher attention as reflected by beta-waves. Furthermore, as participants began ARSG, the allocation of cognitive resource gradually prioritized the frontal area, which controls attention, decision-making, monitoring, and mnemonic processing, while participants also showed an enhanced ability to process information under the ARSG condition as indicated by network characteristics. These electrophysiological changes observed in ARSG were not found under LSG. Thus, this study applied both power spectrum and EEG FC networks analyses to ARSG research, revealing characteristics of brain waves in typical areas and how the brain gradually changes from low-working load states to high-working load states based on real-time EEG recordings.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31100346.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most infant studies rely on the well-established and easy-to-use event-related brain potential (ERP). As a severe disadvantage, ERP computation requires a large number of repetitions of items from the same stimulus-category, compromising both ERPs' reliability and their ecological validity in infant research. We here explore a way to investigate infant continuous EEG responses to an ongoing, engaging signal (i.e., neural tracking) by using multivariate temporal response functions (mTRFs), an approach increasingly popular in adult EEG research. N = 52 infants watched a 5-min episode of an age-appropriate cartoon while the EEG signal was recorded. We estimated and validated forward encoding models of auditory-envelope and visual-motion features. We compared individual and group-based ('generic') models of the infant brain response to comparison data from N = 28 adults. The generic model yielded clearly defined response functions for both, the auditory and the motion regressor. Importantly, this response profile was present also on an individual level, albeit with lower precision of the estimate but above-chance predictive accuracy for the modelled individual brain responses. In sum, we demonstrate that mTRFs are a feasible way of analyzing continuous EEG responses in infants. We observe robust response estimates both across and within participants from only 5 min of recorded EEG signal. Our results open ways for incorporating more engaging and more ecologically valid stimulus materials when probing cognitive, perceptual, and affective processes in infants and young children.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31362048.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until now, however, researchers had little understanding of the details of relationship between different emotional states and various EEG features. To improve the accuracy of EEG-based emotion classification and visualize the changes of emotional states with time, this paper systematically compares three kinds of existing EEG features for emotion classification, introduces an efficient feature smoothing method for removing the noise unrelated to emotion task, and proposes a simple approach to tracking the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold learning. To examine the effectiveness of these methods introduced in this paper, we design a movie induction experiment that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states and collect an EEG data set of six subjects. From experimental results on our EEG data set, we found that (a) power spectrum feature is superior to other two kinds of features; (b) a linear dynamic system based feature smoothing method can significantly improve emotion classification accuracy; and (c) the trajectory of emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with manifold learning.

A total of 12 observers independently annotated emotional episodes regarding their temporal location and duration. The nature of an emotion was characterized with basic attributes, such as arousal and valence, as well as explicit emotion category labels. In addition, annotations include a record of the perceptual evidence for the presence of an emotion. Two variants of the movie were annotated separately: 1) an audio-movie version of Forrest Gump that has been used as a stimulus for the acquisition of a large public functional brain imaging dataset, and 2) the original audio-visual movie. We present reliability and consistency estimates that suggest that both stimuli can be used to study visual and auditory emotion cue processing in real-life like situations. Raw annotations from all observers are publicly released in full in order to maximize their utility for a wide range of applications and possible future extensions. In addition, aggregate time series of inter-observer agreement with respect to particular attributes of portrayed emotions are provided to facilitate adoption of these data.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 25977755.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In human imaging experiments, we compared the brain activity produced in the so-called 'kinetic occipital' area ('KO') when humans perceive shapes generated from kinetic boundaries or from equiluminant colors. 'KO' was activated whenever subjects perceived shapes, no matter how they were derived; it is therefore not specialized for the processing of kinetic contours. The application of independent component analysis (ICA) to imaging data obtained when subjects viewed 22 min of an action movie showed that the time course of activity in 'KO' correlates better with activity in area V3 than with activity in two adjacent areas, V5 and LO. We thus consider 'KO' to be part of the V3 family of areas, and use the terminology of Smith et al. (J Neurosci 18:3816-3830, 1998), to refer to it as area V3B. Recordings from orientation-selective cells in the macaque V3 complex show that the great majority have the same orientational specificity when tested with oriented lines generated from kinetic stimuli or from luminance differences. We conclude that there is no present evidence for a visual area specialized for the processing of kinetic contours in the primate visual brain.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 12507950.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate the neural responses to these sources of novelty during film viewing. We analyzed intracranial recordings in humans across 6328 electrodes from 23 individuals. Responses associated with saccades and film cuts were dominant across the entire brain. Film cuts at semantic event boundaries were particularly effective in the temporal andmedial temporal lobe. Saccades to visual targets with high visual noveltywere also associated with strong neural responses. Specific locations in higher-order association areas showed selectivity to either high or low-novelty saccades.

We leveraged a large-scale neuroimaging dataset to directly investigate the hierarchical reorganization of functional brain activity when watching naturalistic films compared to performing seven cognitive tasks and resting. A thermodynamics-inspired whole-brain model paradigm revealed the generative underlying mechanisms for changing the balance in causal interactions between brain regions in different conditions. Paradoxically, the hierarchy is flatter for movie-watching, and the level of non-reversibility is significantly smaller in comparison to both rest and tasks, where the latter in turn have the highest levels of hierarchy and nonreversibility. The underlying mechanisms were revealed by the model-based generative effective connectivity (GEC). Naturalistic films could therefore provide a fast and convenient way to measure important changes in GEC (integrating functional and anatomical connectivity) found in, for example, neuropsychiatric disorders. Overall, this study demonstrates the benefits of moving toward a more naturalistic neuroscience.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 36638163.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the findings of current studies, modern study that properly characterises the EEG data signal provides a clear classification accuracy of human activities which is distinct from previous research. Various brain wave patterns related to common activities such as sleeping, reading, and watching a movie may be found in the Electroencephalography (EEG) data that has been collected. As a consequence of these activities, we accumulate numerous sorts of emotion signals in our brains, including the Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands. These bands will provide different types of emotion signals in our brain as a result of these activities. As a consequence of the nonstationary nature of EEG recordings, time-frequency-domain techniques, on the other hand, are more likely to provide good findings. The ability to identify different neural rhythm scales using time-frequency representation has also been shown to be a legitimate EEG marker; this ability has also been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for investigating small-scale neural brain oscillations. This paper presents the first time that a frequency analysis of EEG dynamics has been undertaken. An augmenting decomposition consisting of the Versatile Inspiring Wavelet Transform and the Adaptive Wavelet Transform is used in conjunction with the EEG rhythms that were gathered to provide adequate temporal and spectral resolutions. Children's wearable sensors are being used to collect data from a number of sources, including the Internet. The signal is conveyed over the Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, the suggested approach is assessed on two EEG datasets, one of which was obtained in a noisy (i.e., nonshielded) environment and the other was recorded in a shielded environment. The results illustrate the resilience of the proposed training strategy. Therefore, our method contributes to the identification of specific brain activity in children who are taking part in the research as a result of their participation. On the basis of several parameters such as filtering response, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure, the MATLAB simulation software was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35528349.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human studies (using both invasive and noninvasive techniques) have demonstrated that at the population level, auditory cortex follows stimulus envelope. Here we examined the effect of stimulus modulation rate by using a rare opportunity to record both spiking activity and local field potentials (LFP) in auditory cortex of patients during repeated presentations of an audio-visual movie clip presented at normal, double, and quadruple speeds. Mean firing rate during evoked activity remained the same across speeds and the temporal response profile of firing rate modulations at increased stimulus speeds was a linearly scaled version of the response during slower speeds. Additionally, stimulus induced power modulation of local field potentials in the high gamma band (64-128 Hz) exhibited similar temporal scaling as the neuronal firing rate modulations. Our data confirm and extend previous studies in humans and anesthetized animals, supporting a model in which both firing rate, and high-gamma LFP power modulations in auditory cortex follow the temporal envelope of the stimulus across different modulation rates.

They are key to studying the human mind in socio-culturally determined contexts as they allow anchoring to the common ground of embodied and environmentally-engaged cognition. Here we review recent findings from naturalistic neuroscience on neural functions in conditions that mimic lifelike situations. We will focus particularly on neurocinematics, a research field that applies mediated narratives as stimuli for neuroimaging experiments. During the last two decades, this paradigm has contributed to an accumulation of insights about the neural underpinnings of behavior and sensemaking in various narratively contextualized situations particularly pertaining to socio-emotional encounters. One of the key questions in neurocinematics is, how do intersubjectively synchronized brain activations relate to subjective experiences? Another question we address is how to bring natural contexts into experimental studies. Seeking to respond to both questions, we suggest neurocinematic studies to examine three manifestations of the same phenomenon side-by-side: subjective experiences of narrative situations, unfolding of narrative stimulus structure, and neural processes that co-constitute the experience. This approach facilitates identifying experientially meaningful activity patterns in the brain and points out what they may mean in relation to shared and communicable contents. Via rich-featured and temporally contextualized narrative stimuli, neurocinematics attempts to contribute to emerging holistic theories of neural dynamics and connectomics explaining typical and atypical interindividual variability.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 37507066.0","","","","EEG/MEG; Emotional Topology; fMRI; Neural Correlates of Shared Conscious Experience; Neurocinematics; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the distinction could be visible on brain activity timing within the fronto-parietal network. In this study, we used Event-Related Potential (ERP) method to assess the temporal dynamics of object-related and non-object-related action processing. Although both meaningful, only object-related actions involve object motor features. Accordingly, perception of the two action types would show distinct neural correlates. Participants were presented with four movie types (ORA, Object-Related Action, NORA: Non-Object-Related Action and 2 control movies) and were instructed to perform tasks that required explicit or implicit action recognition (specific action recognition or color change detection). Movies were presented as Point-Light Display (PLD) and thus provided only information about gesture kinematics regardless of action type. ERP were computed during movie visual perception and analyzed as a function of movie type and task. The main result revealed a difference between ORA and NORA on the amplitude of the P3a component in the fronto-parietal region. The difference observed around 250 ms after movie onset do not likely origin from variation in low-level visual features or attention resource allocation. Instead, we suggest that it reflects incidental recruitment of object attributes during object-related action perception. The exact nature of these attributes is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The ability to interpret mental content without recourse to behavior is most relevant for understanding patients who may be demonstrably conscious, but entirely unable to speak or move willfully in any way, precluding any systematic investigation of their conscious experience. The lack of consistent behavioral responsivity engenders unique challenges to decoding any conscious experiences these patients may have solely based on their brain activity. For this reason, paradigms that have been successful in healthy individuals cannot serve to interpret conscious mental states in this patient group. Until recently, patient studies have used structured instructions to elicit willful modulation of brain activity according to command, in order to decode the presence of willful brain-based responses in this patient group. In recent work, we have used naturalistic paradigms, such as watching a movie or listening to an audio-story, to demonstrate that a common neural code supports conscious experiences in different individuals. Moreover, we have demonstrated that this code can be used to interpret the conscious experiences of a patient who had remained non-responsive for several years. This approach is easy to administer, brief, and does not require compliance with task instructions. Rather, it engages attention naturally through meaningful stimuli that are similar to the real-world sensory information in a patient's environment. Therefore, it may be particularly suited to probing consciousness and revealing residual brain function in highly impaired, acute, patients in a comatose state, thus helping to improve diagnostication and prognostication for this vulnerable patient group from the critical early stages of severe brain-injury.

In this study, we used electroencephalography to investigate brain activity while participants watched a preferred player win a competitive game (Rock-Paper-Scissors game). In the experimental task, movie clips showed right hand of the two players and played Rock-Paper-Scissors game. We asked participants to explicitly support or cheer for a specific player, and then examined brain activity associated with vicarious reward. For the observed hand movement, previous findings showed that the event-related desynchronization of mu band (8-14 Hz) appeared at the contra-lateral central electrode to the observed hand (If someone sees the right-hand movement, the left central electrode shows the event-related desynchronization of mu-band). During observation of the player, we detected event-related desynchronization of mu band activity in the contra-lateral central electrode as well as mid-frontal beta band (15-22 Hz) activation when the preferred player won. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed a strong phase synchronization between the contra-lateral central electrode and mid-frontal electrode in the mu band when participants received the vicarious reward. Cross-frequency coupling analysis revealed functional integration between the mu and beta bands at mid-frontal electrode. These results indicate the interaction of mu band observed at contra-lateral electrode and beta band observed at mid-frontal electrode coupling, suggesting a link between the mirror neuron system and the reward system during vicarious reward.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31866846.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To explore the level at which aging impairs sound segregation, we measured auditory evoked fields (AEFs) using magnetoencephalography while young, middle-aged, and older adults were presented with complex sounds that either had all of their harmonics in tune or had the third harmonic mistuned by 4 or 16% of its original value. During the recording, participants were asked to ignore the stimuli and watch a muted subtitled movie of their choice. For each participant, the AEFs were modeled with a pair of dipoles in the superior temporal plane, and the effects of age and mistuning were examined on the amplitude and latency of the resulting source waveforms. Mistuned stimuli generated an early positivity (60-100 ms), an object-related negativity (ORN) (140-180 ms) that overlapped the N1 and P2 waves, and a positive displacement that peaked at similar to 230 ms (P230) after sound onset. The early mistuning-related enhancement was similar in all three age groups, whereas the subsequent modulations (ORN and P230) were reduced in older adults. These age differences in auditory cortical activity were associated with a reduced likelihood of hearing two sounds as a function of mistuning. The results reveal that inharmonicity is rapidly and automatically registered in all three age groups but that the perception of concurrent sounds declines with age.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:11:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 17287505.0","","","","Modified Movie Stimulus; OUT-OF-SCOPE; UNRELATED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ancient Indian treatise on performing arts known as Natyashastra categorizes emotions into nine classes, known as Rasas. Rasa-as opposed to a pure emotion-is defined as a superposition of certain transitory, dominant, and temperamental emotional states. Although Rasas have been widely discussed in the text, dedicated brain imaging studies have not been conducted in their research. Our study examines the neural oscillations, recorded through electroencephalography (EEG) imaging, that are elicited while experiencing emotional states corresponding to Rasas. We identify differences among them using network-based functional connectivity metrics in five different frequency bands. Further, Random Forest models are trained on the extracted network features, and we present our findings based on classifier predictions. We observe slow (delta) and fast brain waves (beta and gamma) exhibited the maximum discriminating features between Rasas, whereas alpha and theta bands showed fewer distinguishable pairs. Out of nine Rasas, Sringaram (love), Bibhatsam (odious), and Bhayanakam (terror) were distinguishable from other Rasas the most across frequency bands. On the scale of most network metrics, Raudram (rage) and Sringaram are on the extremes, which also resulted in their good classification accuracy of 95%. This is reminiscent of the circumplex model where anger and contentment/happiness are on extremes on the pleasant scale. Interestingly, our results are consistent with the previous studies which highlight the significant role of higher frequency oscillations in the classification of emotions, in contrast to the alpha band that has shows non-significant differences across emotions. This research contributes to one of the first attempts to investigate the neural correlates of Rasas. Therefore, the results of this study can potentially guide the explorations into the entrainment of brain oscillations between performers and viewers, which can further lead to better performances and viewer experience.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35840823.0","<p>need to look at methods?</p>","","","EEG/MEG; Functional Connectivity; New Emitional Rating; Short Clips; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, the film industry hinges on viewers looking at characters doing all sorts of narrative activities. From previous works, we know that media and non-media professionals perceive differently audiovisuals with cuts. Media professionals present a lower eye-blink rate, a lower activity in frontal and central cortical areas, and a more organized functional brain connectivity when watching audiovisual cuts. Here, we aimed to determine how audiovisuals with no formal interruptions such as cuts were perceived by media and non-media professionals. Moreover, we wondered how motor actions of characters in films would have an impact on the brain activities of the two groups of observers. We presented a narrative with 24 motor actions in a one-shot movie in wide shot with no cuts to 40 participants. We recorded the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the participants and analyzed it for the periods corresponding to the 24 motor actions (24 actions x 40 participants = 960 potential trials). In accordance with collected results, we observed differences in the EEG activity of the left primary motor cortex. A spectral analysis of recorded EEG traces indicated the presence of significant differences in the beta band between the two groups after the onset of the motor activities, while no such differences were found in the alpha band.

In the current study, we have employed fast optical neuroimaging with a frequency-domain oximeter to examine whether syntactic violations of English bare infinitives in the non-finite complement clause would trigger syntax-related mismatch effects. Recorded sentences of bare or full infinitive structures (without or with the 'to' infinitival marker) with syntactically correct or incorrect versions and non-syntactic lexical items (verbs) were presented to native speakers of English (n = 8) during silent movie viewing as a passive oddball task. The analysis of source strength (i.e., minimum norm current amplitudes) revealed that the syntactic category violations of bare object infinitives led to significantly more robust optical mismatch effects than the other syntactic violation and non-structural, lexical elements. This mismatch response had a peak latency of 186 ms in the left anterior superior temporal gyrus. In combination with our prior MEG report (Kubota et al. in Neurosci Lett 662:195-204, 2018), the present optical neuroimaging findings show that syntactic marking (unmarked-to-marked) violations of the bare object infinitive against the rule of the mental grammar enhance the signal strength exactly in the same manner seen with MEG scanning, including the peak latency of mismatch activity and the activated area of the brain.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 32945889.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Being crucial for implementing pro-social behaviors, empathy is considered as inherently altruistic. Here we explored whether the personal experience of pain make individuals less inclined to share others' pain. We used laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) to explore whether observation of painful or non-noxious stimuli delivered to a stranger model induced any modulation in the pain system of onlookers who were suffering from pain induced by the laser stimuli. After LEPs recording, participants rated intensity and unpleasantness of the laser pain, and of the pain induced by the movie in themselves and in the model. Mere observation of needles penetrating the model's hand brought about a specific reduction of the N1/P1 LEP component, related to the activation of somatic nodes of the pain matrix. Such reduction is stronger in onlookers who rated the pain intensity induced by the pain movie as higher in themselves and lower in the model. Conversely, the N2a-P2 component, supposedly associated to affective pain qualities, did not show any specific modulation during observation of others' pain. Thus, viewing `flesh and bone' pain in others specifically modulates neural activity in the pain matrix sensory node. Moreover, this socially-derived inhibitory effect is correlated with the intensity of the pain attributed to self rather than to others suggesting that being in pain may bias the empathic relation with stranger models towards self-centred instead than other-related stances.

Previous studies have shown that infants' temporal region responds to faces (e.g., Otsuka et al., 2007). A recent electroencephalography study showed that the neural activity of infants was modulated by repeated presentation of Peekaboo.  Some fNIRS studies also revealed that the movie of Peekaboo  activated the hemodynamic response of the temporal region in infancy. However, no studies have shown the hemodynamic modulation of the temporal region according to the repeated presentation of Peekaboo  in infants. In order to examine whether the hemodynamic responses of the temporal region were modulated by repeated presentation of Peekaboo,  we compared the activity of the temporal region between the early and late trials. We set long and short delays before face-presentation. The results showed that the concentration of oxy-hemoglobin in the right occipitotemporal region (Ch 21) in both conditions increased after the presentation of Peekaboo  relative to the baseline. Moreover, in the long delay condition, the hemodynamic modulation of the right occipitotemporal region was induced according to the repeated presentation of Peekaboo  in infants.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35370581.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although typical changes in cortical activity such as seen in EEG and LFP measurements are associated with change in state of arousal, it remains unclear what in the constitution of such state dependent activity enables this profound enhancement of ability. We put forward the hypothesis that arousal modulates cortical activity by rendering it more fit to represent information. We argue that representational capacity is of a dual nature-it requires not only that cortical tissue generate complex activity (i.e. spatiotemporal neuronal events), but also a complex cortical activity space (which is comprised of such spatiotemporal events). We explain that the topological notion of complexity-homology-is the pertinent measure of the complexity of neuronal activity spaces, as homological structure indicates not only the degree to which underlying activity is inherently clustered but also registers the effective dimensionality of the configurations formed by such clusters. Changes of this sort in the structure of cortical activity spaces can serve as the basis of the enhanced capacity to make perceptual/behavioral distinctions brought about by arousal. To show the feasibility of these ideas, we analyzed voltage sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) data acquired from primate visual cortex in disparate states of arousal. Our results lend some support to the theory: first as arousal increased so did the complexity of activity (that is the complexity of VSDI movies). Moreover, the complexity of structure of activity space (that is VSDI movie space) as measured by persistent homology-a multi scale topological measure of complexity-increased with arousal as well.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 14:58:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 19326198.0","","","","Arousal Impact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alongside the sheer growth in the amount and variety of information content that we are presented with through modern media, there is increased variability in the degree to which we absorb that information. Traditional research on attention has illuminated the basic principles of sensory selection to isolated features or locations, but it provides little insight into the neural underpinnings of our attentional engagement with modern naturalistic content. Here, we show in human subjects that the reliability of an individual's neural responses with respect to a larger group provides a highly robust index of the level of attentional engagement with a naturalistic narrative stimulus. Specifically, fast electroencephalographic evoked responses were more strongly correlated across subjects when naturally attending to auditory or audiovisual narratives than when attention was directed inward to a mental arithmetic task during stimulus presentation. This effect was strongest for audiovisual stimuli with a cohesive narrative and greatly reduced for speech stimuli lacking meaning. For compelling audiovisual narratives, the effect is remarkably strong, allowing perfect discrimination between attentional state across individuals. Control experiments rule out possible confounds related to altered eye movement trajectories or order of presentation. We conclude that reliability of evoked activity reproduced across subjects viewing the same movie is highly sensitive to the attentional state of the viewer and listener, which is aided by a cohesive narrative.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:07:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 26961961.0","","","","EEG/MEG; Impact of Attention; Neural Correlates of Shared Conscious Experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The insula is considered to be a core part of the pain network in the brain. Previous studies have suggested a relationship between the posterior insula (PI) and sensory processing, and between the anterior insula (AI) and cognitive-affective factors. Objectives: Our aim was to distinguish sensory and cognitive responses in pain-related insular activities. Methods: We recorded spatiotemporal insular activation patterns of healthy participants (n = 20) during pain or tactile processing with painful or nonpainful movie stimuli, using a magnetoencephalography. We compared the peak latency between PI and AI activities in each stimulus condition, and between pain and tactile processing in each response. The peak latency and amplitude between different movies were then examined to explore the effects of cognitive influence. A visual analogue scale was used to assess subjective perception. Results: The results revealed one clear PI activity and 2 AI activities (early and late) in insular responses induced by pain/tactile stimulation. The early response transmitted from the PI to AI was observed during sensory-associated brain activity, whereas the late AI response was observed during cognitive-associated activity. In addition, we found that painful movie stimuli had a significant influence on both late AI activity and subjective perception, caused by nonpainful actual stimulation. Conclusions: The current findings suggested that late AI activation reflects the processing of cognitive pain information, whereas the PI and early AI responses reflect sensory processing.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35187379.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is currently unclear how this compression manifests in brain activity. One possibility is that a compressed retrieved memory manifests as a neural pattern which is more dissimilar to the original, relative to a more detailed or vivid memory. However, we argue that measuring raw dissimilarity alone is insufficient, as it confuses a variety of interesting and uninteresting changes. To address this problem, we examine brain pattern changes that are consistent across people. We show that temporal compression in individuals' retelling of past events predicts systematic encoding-to-recall transformations in several higher associative regions. These findings elucidate how neural representations are not simply reactivated, but can also be transformed due to temporal compression during a universal form of human memory expression: verbal retelling.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35606497.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each change in our experience must be supported by some corresponding change in neurophysiological activity. Differentiation analysis, which quantifies the differences in brain activity by measuring the distances between observed brain states, was applied here to continuous high-density electroencephalographic data recorded while participants watched short video clips. These clips were manipulated in various ways to change the degree of meaningfulness of their contents. We found that neurophysiological differentiation mirrored that of phenomenal differentiation, being higher for meaningful clips and lower for phase-scrambled versions or random noise. The distinction between meaningful and meaningless clips was present even at the individual level, and moreover, differentiation values correlated with individual subjective reports of meaningfulness. Spatial and spectral breakdowns of the overall effect showed frontal and posterior ROIs and highlighted specific roles for different spectral bands. Comparing the results with a multivariate decoding approach reveals that the two methods are capturing different aspects of brain activity and highlights a crucial theoretical distinction between the level and pattern of activity. In future applications, differentiation analysis may be used to evaluate the subjective meaningfulness of stimuli when behavioral responses may be inadequate, as with disorders of consciousness.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29762103.0","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>interestingly puts into light the idea that LEVEL and PATTERN of activity translate two different things.</p> </div>","","","EEG/MEG; Neural Correlates of Shared Conscious Experience; Short Clips; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the theoretical bases for how humans can predict the preference of others, one tends to estimate the other's preference using a perceived difference between the other and self. Previous neuroimaging studies have revealed that the network of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is related to the ability of predicting others' preference. However, it still remains unknown about the temporal patterns of neural activities for others' preference prediction through thin-slicing. To investigate such temporal aspects of neural activities, we investigated human electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during the task of predicting the preference of others while only a facial picture of others was provided. Twenty participants (all female, average age: 21.86) participated in the study. In each trial of the task, participants were shown a picture of either a target person or self for 3 s, followed by the presentation of a movie poster over which participants predicted the target person's preference as liking or disliking. The time-frequency EEG analysis was employed to analyze temporal changes in the amplitudes of brain oscillations. Participants could predict others' preference for movies with accuracy of 56.89 +/- 3.16% and 10 out of 20 participants exhibited prediction accuracy higher than a chance level (95% interval). There was a significant difference in the power of the parietal alpha(10 similar to 13 Hz) oscillation 0.6 similar to 0.8 s after the onset of poster presentation between the cases when participants predicted others' preference and when they reported self preference (p < 0.05). The power of brain oscillations at any frequency band and time period during the trial did not show a significant correlation with individual prediction accuracy. However, when we measured differences of the power between the trials of predicting other's preference and reporting self-preference, the right temporal beta oscillations 1.6 similar to 1.8 s after the onset of facial picture presentation exhibited a significant correlation with individual accuracy. Our results suggest that right temporoparietal beta oscillations may be correlated with one's ability to predict what others prefer with minimal information.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:07:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29479312.0","","","","OUT-OF-SCOPE; UNRELATED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although we are mostly unaware of internal bodily processes, such as our heartbeats, they may be influenced by and in turn influence our perception and emotional feelings. Although there is a recent focus on understanding cardiac interoceptive activity and interaction with brain activity during emotion processing, the investigation of cardiac-brain interactions with more ecologically valid naturalistic emotional stimuli is still very limited. We also do not understand how an essential aspect of emotions, such as context familiarity, influences affective feelings and is linked to statistical interaction between cardiac and brain activity. Hence, to answer these questions, we designed an exploratory study by recording ECG and EEG signals for the emotional events while participants were watching emotional movie clips. Participants also rated their familiarity with the stimulus on the familiarity scale. Linear mixed effect modelling was performed in which the ECG power and familiarity were considered as predictors of EEG power. We focused on three brain regions, including prefrontal (PF), frontocentral (FC) and parietooccipital (PO). The analyses showed that the interaction between the power of cardiac activity in the mid-frequency range and the power in specific EEG bands is dependent on familiarity, such that the interaction is stronger with high familiarity. In addition, the results indicate that arousal is predicted by cardiac-brain interaction, which also depends on familiarity. The results support emotional theories that emphasize context dependency and interoception. Multimodal studies with more realistic stimuli would further enable us to understand and predict different aspects of emotional experience.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35741588.0","","","","Bodily Signals; EEG/MEG; Link between neural correlates and bodily signals; Short Clips; Subjective Rating","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our experiment we investigated a third type of perspective, which is a slanted view. This slanted perspective is a compromise between route and survey perspectives, offering both information about landmarks as in route perspective and geometric information as in survey perspective. We hypothesized that the use of slanted perspective would allow the brain to use either egocentric or allocentric strategies during storage and recall. Twenty-six subjects were scanned (3-Tesla fMRI) during the encoding of a path (40-s navigation movie within a virtual city). They were given the task of encoding a segment of travel in the virtual city and of subsequent shortcut-finding for each perspective: route, slanted and survey. The analysis of the behavioral data revealed that perspective influenced response accuracy, with significantly more correct responses for slanted and survey perspectives than for route perspective. Comparisons of brain activation with route, slanted, and survey perspectives suggested that slanted and survey perspectives share common brain activity in the left lingual and fusiform gyri and lead to very similar behavioral performance. Slanted perspective was also associated with similar activation to route perspective during encoding in the right middle occipital gyrus. Furthermore, slanted perspective induced intermediate patterns of activation (in between route and survey) in some brain areas, such as the right lingual and fusiform gyri. Our results suggest that the slanted perspective may be considered as a hybrid perspective. This result offers the first empirical support for the choice to present the slanted perspective in many navigational aids.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:12:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 23209583.0","","","","fMRI; Modified Movie Stimulus; Short Clips","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although self-report provides valuable information regarding participants' affective responses, prior studies have raised the concern that the attentional demands of reporting on affective experience may obscure neural activations reflecting more natural affective responses. In the present study, we used potent emotion-eliciting amusing and sad films, employed a novel method of continuous self-reported rating of emotion experience, and compared the impact of rating with passive viewing of amusing and sad films. Subjective rating of ongoing emotional responses did not decrease either self-reported experience of emotion or neural activations relative to passive viewing in any brain regions. Rating, relative to passive viewing, produced increased activity in anterior cingulate, insula, and several other areas associated with introspection of emotion. These results support the use of continuous emotion measures and emotionally engaging films to study the dynamics of emotional responding and suggest that there may be some contexts in which the attention to emotion induced by reporting emotion experience does not disrupt emotional responding either behaviorally or neurally.

Using narrative film clip stimuli, this study investigated these effects in naturalistic event memories examining behaviour and neural activation to help explain this paradox. Furthermore, we examined encoding, immediate retrieval, and one-week delayed retrieval to determine how these effects evolve over time. Behaviourally, both congruence with prior knowledge and incongruence/novelty enhanced memory for events, though incongruent events were recalled with more errors over time. During encoding, greater congruence with prior knowledge was correlated with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and parietal activation, suggesting that these areas may play a key role in linking current episodic processing with prior knowledge. Encoding of increasingly incongruent events, on the other hand, was correlated with increasing activation in, and functional connectivity between, the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and posterior sensory cortices. During immediate and delayed retrieval the mPFC and MTL each demonstrated functional connectivity that varied based on the congruence of events with prior knowledge; with connectivity between the MTL and occipital regions found for incongruent events, while congruent events were associated with functional connectivity between the mPFC and the inferior parietal lobules and middle frontal gyri. These results demonstrate patterns of neural activity and connectivity that shift based on the nature of the event being experienced or remembered, and that evolve over time. Furthermore, they suggest potential mechanisms by which both congruence with prior knowledge and incongruence/novelty may enhance memory, through mPFC and MTL functional connectivity, respectively.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 29474955.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prevalence may be higher because of selection bias. The Epilepsy Foundation reviewed light-induced seizures in 2005. Since then, images on social media, virtual reality, three-dimensional (3D) movies, and the Internet have proliferated. Hundreds of studies have explored the mechanisms and presentations of photosensitive seizures, justifying an updated review. This literature summary derives from a nonsystematic literature review via PubMed using the terms photosensitive and epilepsy. The photoparoxysmal response (PPR) is an electroencephalography (EEG) phenomenon, and photosensitive seizures (PS) are seizures provoked by visual stimulation. Photosensitivity is more common in the young and in specific forms of generalized epilepsy. PS can coexist with spontaneous seizures. PS are hereditable and linked to recently identified genes. Brain imaging usually is normal, but special studies imaging white matter tracts demonstrate abnormal connectivity. Occipital cortex and connected regions are hyperexcitable in subjects with light-provoked seizures. Mechanisms remain unclear. Video games, social media clips, occasional movies, and natural stimuli can provoke PS. Virtual reality and 3D images so far appear benign unless they contain specific provocative content, for example, flashes. Images with flashes brighter than 20 candelas/m(2) at 3-60 (particularly 15-20) Hz occupying at least 10 to 25% of the visual field are a risk, as are red color flashes or oscillating stripes. Equipment to assay for these characteristics is probably underutilized. Prevention of seizures includes avoiding provocative stimuli, covering one eye, wearing dark glasses, sitting at least two meters from screens, reducing contrast, and taking certain antiseizure drugs. Measurement of PPR suppression in a photosensitivity model can screen putative antiseizure drugs. Some countries regulate media to reduce risk. Visually-induced seizures remain significant public health hazards so they warrant ongoing scientific and regulatory efforts and public education.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35132632.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We scanned 16 participants with fMRI while they viewed two kinds of stimulus sequences. In the coherent condition, static frames from a movie of a single, intransitive whole-body action were presented in the correct order. In the incoherent condition, a series of frames from multiple actions (involving one actor) were presented. ROI analyses showed that the EBA, unlike area MT+and the posterior superior temporal sulcus, responded more to the incoherent than to the coherent conditions. Whole brain analyses revealed increased activation to the coherent sequences in parietal and frontal regions that have been implicated in the observation and control of movement. We suggest that the EBA response adapts when succeeding images depict relatively similar postures (coherent condition) compared to relatively different postures (incoherent condition). We propose that the EBA plays a unique role in the perception of action, by representing the static structure, rather than dynamic aspects, of the human form.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 18633775.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still unanswered questions include whether midazolam-induced sigma-augmentation also involves the medial temporal region, which plays a role in memory encoding. Taking advantage of rare and unique opportunities to monitor neuronal activities using intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) recording, we determined how intravenous administration of midazolam elicited spectral frequency changes in the human cerebral cortex, including the medial temporal region. We studied three children with focal epilepsy who underwent subdural electrode placement and extraoperative ECoG recording for subsequent resection of the seizure focus; an intravenous bolus of midazolam was given to abort an ongoing simple partial seizure or to provide sedation prior to induction of general anesthesia. 'Midazolam-induced ECoG frequency alteration' in sites distant from the seizure focus was sequentially animated on their individual three-dimensional MR images. The common ECoG changes induced by midazolam included gradual augmentation of sigma-oscillations (12-16 Hz) in the widespread non-epileptic regions, including the medial temporal region. The spatial and temporal alteration of ECoG spectral frequency pattern can be appreciated via animation movies. Midazolam-induced sigma-augmentation was observed in the medial temporal region in our relatively small cohort of human subjects. In-vivo animation of ECoG spectral measures provided a unique situation to study the effect of midazolam on neuronal processing in the deep brain regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These models are built not only from information present in the current narrative, but also from prior knowledge about schematic event scripts, which describe typical event sequences encountered throughout a lifetime. We analyzed fMRI data from 44 human subjects (male and female) presented with 16 three-minute stories, consisting of four schematic events drawn from two different scripts (eating at a restaurant or going through the airport). Aside from this shared script structure, the stories varied widely in terms of their characters and storylines, and were presented in two highly dissimilar formats (audiovisual clips or spoken narration). One group was presented with the stories in an intact temporal sequence, while a separate control group was presented with the same events in scrambled order. Regions including the posterior medial cortex, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and superior frontal gyrus exhibited schematic event patterns that generalized across stories, subjects, and modalities. Patterns in mPFC were also sensitive to overall script structure, with temporally scrambled events evoking weaker schematic representations.

W.","Attention modulates beta oscillations during prolonged tactile stimulation","","","","10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07094.x","","The inter-play between changes in beta-band (14-30-Hz) cortical rhythms and attention during somatosensation informs us about where and when relevant processes occur in the brain. As such, we investigated the effects of attention on somatosensory evoked and induced responses using vibrotactile stimulation and magnetoencephalographic recording. Subjects received trains of vibration at 23 Hz to the right index finger while watching a movie and ignoring the somatosensory stimuli or paying attention to the stimuli to detect a change in the duration of the stimulus. The amplitude of the evoked 23-Hz steady-state response in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) was enhanced by attention and the underlying dipole source was located 2 mm more medially, indicating top-down recruitment of additional neuronal populations for the functionally relevant stimulus. Attentional modulation of the somatosensory evoked response indicates facilitation of early processing of the tactile stimulus. Beta-band activity increased after vibration offset in the contralateral primary motor cortex (MI) [event-related synchronization (ERS)] and this increase was larger for attended than ignored stimuli. Beta-band activity decreased in the ipsilateral SI prior to stimulus offset [event-related desynchronization (ERD)] for attended stimuli only. Whereas attention modulation of the evoked response was confined to the contralateral SI, event-related changes of beta-band activity involved contralateral SI-MI and inter-hemispheric SI-SI connections. Modulation of neural activity in such a large sensorimotor network indicates a role for beta activity in higher-order processing.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:07:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 20384818.0","","","","EEG/MEG; Movie As Secondary; OUT-OF-SCOPE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined how these endogenously driven oculomotor patterns impact topography and topology of functional brain networks. We used a dataset consisting of eyes-open resting-state (RS) fMRI data with simultaneous eye tracking. The eye-tracking data indicated minor movements during rest, which correlated modestly with RS BOLD data. However, eye-tracking data correlated well with echo-planar imaging time series sampled from the area of the eye-orbit (EO-EPI), which is a signal previously used to identify eye movements during exogenous saccades and movie viewing. Further analyses showed that EO-EPI data were correlated with activity in an extensive motor and sensorimotor network, including components of the dorsal attention network and the frontal eye fields. Partialling out variance related to EO-EPI from RS data reduced connectivity, primarily between sensorimotor and visual areas. It also produced networks with higher modularity, lower mean connectivity strength, and lower mean clustering coefficient. Our results highlight new aspects of endogenous eye movement control during wakeful rest. They show that oculomotor-related contributions form an important component of RS network topology, and that those should be considered in interpreting differences in network structure between populations or as a function of different experimental conditions.AUTHOR SUMMARYWe studied how subtle eye movements made during fixation, in absence of any other task, are related to resting-state connectivitymeasured using fMRI. We used a dataset for which eye tracking and BOLD resting-state were acquired simultaneously. We correlated brain activity with both eye-tracking metrics as well as time series sampled from the area of the eye orbits (EO-EPI). Eye-tracking data correlated wellwith the EO-EPI data. Furthermore, EO-EPI correlated with BOLD signal in sensorimotor and visual brain systems. Removing variance related to EO-EPI reduced connectivity between sensorimotor and visual areas and resulted in more modular resting-state networks. Our findings show that oculomotor-related contributions are an important component of resting-state network topology, and that they can be studied using EPI data from the eye orbits.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 34189373.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The elements that will constitute amemory episode are processed in specialized but distinct brain modules. The binding of these elements is most likely mediated by fast-acting long-term potentiation (LTP), which relies on the precise timing of neural activity [2]. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus orchestrate such timing as demonstrated by animal studies in vitro [3, 4] and in vivo [5, 6], suggesting a causal role of theta activity for the formation of complex memory episodes, but direct evidence from humans is missing. Here, we show that human episodic memory formation depends on phase synchrony between different sensory cortices at the theta frequency. By modulating the luminance of visual stimuli and the amplitude of auditory stimuli, we directly manipulated the degree of phase synchrony between visual and auditory cortices. Memory for sound-movie associations was significantly better when the stimuli were presented in phase compared to out of phase. This effect was specific to theta (4 Hz) and did not occur in slower (1.7 Hz) or faster (10.5 Hz) frequencies. These findings provide the first direct evidence that episodic memory formation in humans relies on a theta-specific synchronization mechanism.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 28988860.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ability extends even to the attribution of mental states to animations featuring simple geometric shapes, such as the Frith-Happe animations in which two triangles move either purposelessly (Random condition), exhibit purely physical movement (Goal-directed condition), or move as if one triangle is reacting to the other triangle's mental states (ToM condition). While this capacity in humans has been thoroughly established, research on nonhuman primates has yielded inconsistent results. This study explored how marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a highly social primate species, process Frith-Happe animations by examining gaze patterns and brain activations of marmosets and humans as they observed these animations. We revealed that both marmosets and humans exhibited longer fixations on one of the triangles in ToM animations, compared to other conditions. However, we did not observe the same pattern of longer overall fixation duration on the ToM animations in marmosets as identified in humans. Furthermore, our findings reveal that both species activated extensive and comparable brain networks when viewing ToM versus Random animations, suggesting that marmosets differentiate between these scenarios similarly to humans. While marmosets did not mimic human overall fixation patterns, their gaze behavior and neural activations indicate a distinction between ToM and non-ToM scenarios. This study expands our understanding of nonhuman primate cognitive abilities, shedding light on potential similarities and differences in ToM processing between marmosets and humans.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 37449983.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the brain state transitions when exposed to continuous and naturalistic stimuli with rich affection variations remain poorly understood. This study proposes a dynamic hyperalignment algorithm (dHA) to functionally align the inter-subject neural activity. The hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to study how the brain dynamics responds to emotion during long-time movie-viewing activity. The results showed that dHA significantly improved inter-subject consistency and allowed more consistent temporal HMM states across participants. Afterward, grouping the emotions in a clustering dendrogram revealed a hierarchical grouping of the HMM states. Further emotional sensitivity and specificity analyses of ordered states revealed the most significant differences in happiness and sadness. We then compared the activation map in HMM states during happiness and sadness and found significant differences in the whole brain, but strong activation was observed during both in the superior temporal gyrus, which is related to the early process of emotional prosody processing. A comparison of the inter-network functional connections indicates unique functional connections of the memory retrieval and cognitive network with the cerebellum network during happiness. Moreover, the persistent bilateral connections among salience, cognitive, and sensorimotor networks during sadness may reflect the interaction between high-level cognitive networks and low-level sensory networks. The main results were verified by the second session of the dataset. All these findings enrich our understanding of the brain states related to emotional variation during naturalistic stimuli.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35244856.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the current study was to understand how processing resources are distributed among attended and unattended sounds during auditory scene analysis. We used a three-stream paradigm with four acoustic features uniquely defining each sound stream (frequency, envelope shape, spatial location, tone quality). We manipulated task load by having participants perform a difficult auditory task and an easy movie-viewing task with the same set of sounds in separate conditions. The mismatch negativity (MMN) component of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) was measured to evaluate sound processing in both conditions. We found no effect of task demands on unattended sound processing: MMNs were elicited by unattended deviants during both low- and high-load task conditions. A key factor of this result was the use of unique tone feature combinations to distinguish each of the three sound streams, strengthening the segregation of streams. In the auditory task, the P3b component demonstrates a two-stage process of target evaluation. Thus, these results, in conjunction with results of previous studies, suggest that stimulus-driven factors that strengthen stream segregation can free up processing capacity for higher-level analyses. The results illustrate the interactive nature of top-down and stimulus-driven processes in stream formation, supporting a distributive theory of attention that balances the strength of the bottom-up input with perceptual goals in analyzing the auditory scene.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:06:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31578762.0","","","","Movie As Secondary; OUT-OF-SCOPE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"9WP5XN7D","journalArticle","","Franssen Sieske, Jansen Anita","Effects of mindset on hormonal responding, neural representations, subjective experience and intake","","","","10.1016/j.physbeh.2022.113746","","A person can alternate between food-related mindsets, which in turn may depend on one's emotional state or situation. Being in a certain mindset can influence food-related thoughts, but interestingly it might also affect eating-related physiological responses. The current study investigates the influence of an induced 'loss of control' mindset as compared to an 'in control' mindset on hormonal, neural and behavioural responses to chocolate stimuli. Mindsets were induced by having female chocolate lovers view a short movie during two sessions in a within-subjects design. Neural responses to visual chocolate stimuli were measured using an ultra-high field (7T) scanner. Momentary ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels were determined on five moments and were simultaneously assessed with self-reports on perceptions of chocolate craving, hunger and feelings of control. Furthermore, chocolate intake was measured using a bogus chocolate taste test. It was hypothesized that the loss of control mindset would lead to hormonal, neural and behavioural responses that prepare for ongoing food intake, even after eating, while the control mindset would lead to responses reflecting satiety. Results show that neural activity in the mesocorticolimbic system was stronger for chocolate stimuli than for neutral stimuli and that ghrelin and GLP-1 levels responded to food intake, irrespective of mindset. Self-reported craving and actual chocolate intake were affected by mindset, in that cravings and intake were higher with a loss of control mindset than with a control mindset. Interestingly, these findings suggest that physiology on the one hand (hormonal and neural responses) and behavior and subjective experience (food intake and craving) on the other hand are not in sync, are not equally affected by mindset.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:13:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 35182553.0","","","","Bodily Signals; fMRI; Short Clips; Subjective Experience Component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NC9INXVY","journalArticle","","Alain C, Schuler BM","Neural activity associated with distinguishing concurrent auditory objects","","","","10.1121/1.1434942","","The neural processes underlying concurrent sound segregation were examined by using event-related brain potentials. Participants were presented with complex sounds comprised of multiple harmonies, one of which could be mistuned so that it was no longer an integer multiple of the fundamental. In separate blocks of trials, short-, middle-, and long-duration sounds were presented and participants indicated whether they heard one sound (i.e., buzz) or two sounds (i.e., buzz plus another sound with a pure-tone quality). The auditory stimuli were also presented while participants watched a silent movie in order to evaluate the extent to which the mistuned harmonic could be automatically detected. The perception of the mistuned harmonic as a separate sound was associated with a biphasic negative-positive potential that peaked at about 150 and 350 ins after sound onset, respectively. Long duration sounds also elicited a sustained potential that was greater in amplitude when the mistuned harmonic was perceptually segregated from the complex sound. The early negative wave, referred to as the object-related negativity (ORN), was present during both active and passive listening, whereas the positive wave and the mistuning-related changes in sustained potentials were present only when participants attended to the stimuli. These results are consistent with a two-stage model of auditory scene analysis in which the acoustic wave is automatically decomposed into perceptual groups that can be identified by higher executive functions. The ORN and the positive waves were little affected by sound duration, indicating that concurrent sound segregation depends on transient neural responses elicited by the discrepancy between the mistuned harmonic and the harmonic frequency expected based on the fundamental frequency of the incoming stimulus.

The inclination to watch others play may be based on our social-cognitive ability to understand the internal states of others. The mirror neuron system, which is activated when a subject observes the actions of others, as well as when they perform the same action themselves, seems to play a crucial role in this process. Our previous study showed that activity of the mirror neuron system was modulated by the outcome of the subject's favored player during observation of a simple competitive game (rock-paper-scissors). However, whether the mirror neuron system responds similarly in a more complex and naturalistic sports game has not yet been fully investigated.Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we measured the activity of motor areas when the subjects, who were amateur baseball field players (non-pitchers), watched short movie clips of scenes in professional baseball games. The subjects were instructed to support either a batter or a pitcher when observing the movie clip. The results showed that activity in the motor area exhibited a strong interaction between the subject's supported side (batter or pitcher) and the outcome (a hit or an out). When the subject supported the batter, motor area activity was significantly higher when the batter made an out than when he made a hit. However, such modulation was not apparent when the subject supported the pitcher.Conclusions/Significance: This result indicates that mirror neuron system activity is modulated by the outcome for a particular player in a competitive game even when observing a complex and naturalistic sports game. We suggest that our inclination to watch competitive games is facilitated by this characteristic of the mirror neuron system.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-11-10 12:46:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 19946372.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For instance, during the resting-state condition, the brain can be clustered into reliable and reproducible networks (e.g., sensory, default, executive networks). Interestingly, the same networks emerge during active conditions in response to various tasks. If similar patterns of neural activity have been found across diverse conditions, and therefore, different underlying processes and experiences of the environment, is the brain organized by a fundamental organizational principle? To test this, we applied mathematical formalisms borrowed from quantum mechanisms to model electroencephalogram (EEG) data. We uncovered a tendency for EEG signals to be localized in anterior regions of the brain during “rest”, and more uniformly distributed while engaged in a task (i.e., watching a movie). Moreover, we found analogous values to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, suggesting a common underlying architecture of human brain activity in resting and task conditions. This underlying architecture manifests itself in the novel constant KBrain, which is extracted from the brain state with the least uncertainty. We would like to state that we are using the mathematics of quantum mechanics, but not claiming that the brain behaves as a quantum object.","","2023-11-10 12:46:24","2023-12-01 15:08:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 34611185.0","","","","EEG/MEG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
